Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood.\\nIn the process, however, he misidentified Hasan as Nidal Hussein and said the shooting happened at Fort Knox in Kentucky.\\nHe also said Hasan had died a martyr, though in fact he remains alive on military death row.\\nCourt documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State.\\nSimply expressing support for a terrorist organization or attack is not against the law.\\nPatel\\'s crime was failing to disclose his trips to Jordan when he was trying to join the Army and Air Force in December 2016 and January 2017.\\nCourt documents say Patel lied about his travel history, saying his only time out of the country in the past seven years was a family trip to India in 2011 and 2012.\\nBefore Patel signed the Army application, a recruiter asked him specifically about the travel question and reminded him providing false information could result in criminal charges.\\nDuring the interview, the recruiter asked to see Patel\\'s passport to confirm his travel claims.\\nPatel agreed to bring it by, but two days later he told the State Department he had accidentally thrown it away in October and needed a new one.\\nAfter Patel\\'s arrest in July, investigators found his passport \"near\" the motel room where he was living, the documents said.\\n©2018 The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Va.)\\nVisit The Virginian-Pilot at pilotonline.com\\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\\n',\n",

Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton.\\n“I’ll have to get back to you on that,” Horowitz said, and the IG was “not sure” if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material.\\nIf the IG did know the subject of the president’s communications with Clinton, he failed to reveal any details.\\nHorowitz “would have to ask” if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said “not the president himself.”\\nRep. King asked Horowitz about his first encounter with the switch of “extremely careless” for ‘gross negligence,” which violated a criminal statute.\\nHorowitz found that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Comey were all involved.\\nThe IG also said his team focused on the fact that the classified material on Clinton’s server was “not clearly marked,” which repeated one of Clinton’s claims about her negligence.\\nAs for the question of her “intent,” Horowitz said it arose “months earlier,” maybe in 2015, though he couldn’t be sure.\\nKing said President Obama had suggested the “careless but not intentional” language in a “60 Minutes” appearance in October of 2015.\\nAnd King had observed that in his July 5, 2016 statement, James Comey used “intent” six times.\\nHorowitz said Comey “concealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton.” The IG also described his report as a “thorough, comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts.”\\nThe IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation, the Russia and the Mueller team.\\nHorowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged “tens of thousands of texts.” Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about “we’ll stop” Trump.\\nHorowitz conceded that this meant “stop Trump from becoming president.” The IG said they uncovered that text in May, and Jordan asked “why did we not see it until last Thursday?”\\n“I can’t answer that,” Horowitz said, adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein’s department at the DOJ.\\nJordan concluded that Rosenstein “made the decision that we had to wait a month.”\\nSeveral representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named.\\n“The FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters,” Horowitz said.\\nRep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer, which the IG declined to confirm.\\n“They don’t work in counterintelligence,” said Meadows, who charged that the FBI gave the IG “false information” and altered key witness reports.\\n“How did Comey see the report before it came out?” Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know.\\nHorowitz said Comey didn’t see the whole thing, but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release.\\nBy the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey, Rosenstein, Strzok and others.\\nHorowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok’s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau’s Russia probe.\\nAlso on Tuesday Peter Strzok was “escorted” from the FBI building.\\nAs his lawyer told reporters, Strzok had “played by the rules,” but been targeted by “unfounded personal attacks, political games and inappropriate information leaks.”\\n“I hope he comes and portrays himself as a victim,” Trey Gowdy told Fox News.\\nRep. Bob Goodlatte said the committee would issue a subpoena for Strzok to testify “next week.”\\nThat will make for an exciting show on C-SPAN but none of this would be happening if the deep state plot to “stop” Trump had succeeded.\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Chile \\'cover-up\\' letter contradicts Pope\\n\\n© EPA Pope Francis\\'s trip to Chile and Peru was overshadowed by he row\\nA victim of a paedophile priest in Chile has revealed he wrote to the Pope in 2015 about an alleged cover-up after Francis denied getting evidence.\\nJuan Carlos Cruz, a victim of cleric Fernando Karadima in the 1980s, accused fellow priest Juan Barros of witnessing the abuse and doing nothing.\\nThe Pope caused outrage after a visit to Chile last month by defending Bishop Barros, who was made a bishop in 2015.\\nThe Vatican refused to comment on the letter when approached by BBC News.\\nPope Francis has said in the past that dealing with abuse is vital for the Church\\'s credibility and perpetrators must face \"sanctions\".\\nWhat allegations does the letter make?\\nMr Cruz sent the text of his letter (written in Spanish) to BBC News, showing it was addressed personally to Pope Francis and dated 3 March 2015.\\nThat was more than two weeks before the bishop\\'s ordination in the south Chilean city of Osorno, an event dramatically disrupted by hundreds of protesters accusing Bishop Barros of covering up Karadima\\'s sex attacks on young boys.\\nThe bishop has denied ever knowing about \"the serious abuses\" committed by Karadima, who was never prosecuted in Chile because so much time had passed but was convicted and sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of \"penance and prayer\".\\n\"Holy Father, I decided to write this letter to you because I\\'m tired of fighting, crying and suffering,\" Mr Cruz writes.\\n© AFP Cardinal O\\'Malley (centre) accompanied the Pope in Latin America\\n\"Our story is well known and there\\'s no point reminding you of it, except to tell you of the horror of having experienced this abuse and how I wanted to kill myself.\"\\nIn his letter, he also attaches the full text of a previous letter written a month earlier to the Vatican\\'s top diplomat in Chile, Archbishop Ivo Scapolo.\\nIn that letter, Mr Cruz accuses Bishop Barros of \"doing all the dirty work of Fernando Karadima\", and describes the abuse he suffered and which Bishop Barros allegedly witnessed.\\n\"When we were in a room with Karadima and Juan Barros, if he [Barros] wasn\\'t kissing Karadima, he watched as one of us, the youngest, was touched by Karadima and forced to give him kisses,\" he writes.\\n\"Karadima would say to me: \\'Put your mouth next to mine and stick out your tongue.\\'\\nHe\\'d stick out his and kiss us with his tongue.\\nJuan Barros witnessed all of this on countless occasions, not just in my case but in the case of others as well.\"\\nAddressing himself to Pope Francis, Mr Cruz says: \"Holy Father, Juan Barros says he saw nothing and yet, there are dozens of us who can testify to the fact that not only was he present when Karadima abused us, but that he, too, kissed Karadima and they touched each other.\"\\nHe concludes the letter with this appeal: \"Please Holy Father, don\\'t be like the others.\\nThere are so many of us who despite everything think that you can do something.\\nI treasure my faith, it\\'s what sustains me, but it is slipping away from me.\"\\nHasn\\'t the Pope already apologised?\\n© AFP Karadima was only punished by the Vatican\\nThe remarks that the Pope had made in January that caused such offence were: \"The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will speak.\\nThere is not a single piece of proof against him.\\nEverything is slander.\\nIs this clear?\"\\nThe Pope later apologised for hurting victims\\' feelings \"without meaning to\" but continued to insist there was \"no evidence\" against the bishop.\\n\"In Barros\\'s case, it was studied,\" he said.\\n\"It was restudied.\\nAnd there is no evidence...\\nI don\\'t have evidence to convict.\"\\nHow far did the letter get?\\n© Reuters Bishop Barros (centre) was greeted by angry protesters at his ordination\\nMembers of the Pope\\'s own Commission for the Protection of Minors, set up in 2014 as part of efforts to counter sex abuse by clergy, have told the Associated Press they hand-delivered the letter to Francis\\'s top adviser on sex abuse, Cardinal Sean O\\'Malley, in April 2015.\\nA photo in the AP report shows Marie Collins, a member of the commission at the time, handing the letter to the cardinal.\\n\"When we gave him the letter for the Pope, he assured us he would give it to the Pope and speak of the concerns,\" she told AP.\\n\"And at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.\"\\nMr Cruz told the BBC that Cardinal O\\'Malley had called him later in 2015 to say he had given the letter to the Pope.\\nCardinal O\\'Malley, whose spokesman referred requests for comment to the Vatican, has earned respect for his work in tackling sex abuse by clergy in Boston.\\nCardinal O\\'Malley\\'s disgraced predecessor, the late Cardinal Bernard Law, had moved paedophile priests between parishes rather than addressing victims\\' claims.\\nIn an unusual step, Cardinal O\\'Malley openly criticised the Pope last month for his initial remarks in Chile, saying he had left victims feeling abandoned.\\nPope Francis announced last week he was sending the Vatican\\'s top expert on sexual abuse, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to Chile to investigate the accusations against Bishop Barros.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can\\'t Be Trusted\\n\\nNovember 29, 2018\\nThis Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can\\'t Be Trusted\\nIn 2015 the British Guardian appointed Katherine Viner as editor in chief.\\nUnder her lead the paper took a new direction.\\nWhile it earlier made attempts to balance its shoddier side with some interesting reporting, it is now solidly main stream in the worst sense.\\nIt promotes neo-liberalism and a delves into cranky identity grievances stories.\\nIt also became an main outlet for manipulative propaganda peddled by the British secret services.\\nIts recent fake news story about Paul Manafort, Wikileaks and Julian Assange aptly demonstrates this.\\nThe documentation of it is a bit lengthy but provides that it was a willful fake.\\nOn November 27 the Guardian prepared to publish a story which asserted that Paula Manafort, Trump\\'s former campaign manager, had met Julian Assange, the publisher of Wikileaks, in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on at least three occasions.\\nSome two hours before the story went public it contacted Manafort and Assange\\'s lawyers to get their comments.\\nAssange\\'s Wikileaks responded through its public Twitter account which has 5.4 million followers.\\nOn of those followers is Katherine Viner:\\nWikiLeaks @wikileaks - 13:06 utc - 27 Nov 2018 SCOOP: In letter today to Assange\\'s lawyers, Guardian\\'s Luke Harding, winner of Private Eye\\'s Plagiarist of the Year, falsely claims jailed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had secret meetings with Assange in 2013, 2015 and 2016 in story Guardian are \"planning to run\".\\nIt attached the email the Guardian\\'s Luke Harding had send.\\n90 minutes later the Guardian piece went life.\\nIt led the front page and also appeared in print.\\nThe first version read:\\nManafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and visited around the time he joined Trump’s campaign, the Guardian has been told.\\nSources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 – during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump’s push for the White House.\\nIt is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.\\nBut the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\\nA well-placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016.\\nMonths later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers.\\nManafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is “100% false”.\\nHis lawyers declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.\\nThe piece did not include the public denial Wikileaks issued to its 5.4 million followers one and a half hour before it was published.\\nThe Guardian piece came at a critical moment.\\nCurrently the U.K. and Ecuador conspire to deliver Julian Assange to U.S. authorities.\\nOn Monday special counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort lied to investigators, violating his recent plea deal.\\nThe new sensational claim was immediately picked up by prominent reporters and major main stream outlets.\\nThey distributed is as a factual account.\\nIt is likely that millions of people took note of its claim.\\nBut several people who had followed the Russiagate fairytale and the Mueller investigation were immediately suspicious of the Guardian claim.\\nThe story was weakly sourced and included some details that seemed unlikely to be true.\\nGlenn Greenwald noted that the Ecuadorian embassy is under heavy CCTV surveillance.\\nThere are several guards, and visitors have to provide their identity to enter it.\\nEvery visit is logged.\\nIf Manafort had really visited Assange, it would have long been known:\\nIn sum, the Guardian published a story today that it knew would explode into all sorts of viral benefits for the paper and its reporters even though there are gaping holes and highly sketchy aspects to the story.\\nMoreover, the main author of the story, Luke Harding, is known to be a notorious fraud, a russo-phobe intelligence asset with a personal grievance towards Assange and Wikileaks.\\nA year ago an important Moon of Alabama piece - From Snowden To Russia-gate - The CIA And The Media - mentioned Harding:\\nThe people who promote the \"Russian influence\" nonsense are political operatives or hacks.\\nTake for example Luke Harding of the Guardian who just published a book titled Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win.\\nHe was taken apart in a Real News interview (vid) about the book.\\nThe interviewer pointed out that there is absolutely no evidence in the book to support its claims.\\nWhen asked for any proof for his assertion Harding defensively says that he is just \"storytelling\" - in other words: it is fiction.\\nHarding earlier wrote a book about Edward Snowden which was a similar sham.\\nJulian Assange called it \"a hack job in the purest sense of the term\".\\nHarding is also known as plagiarizer.\\nWhen he worked in Moscow he copied stories and passages from the now defunct Exile, run by Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames.\\nThe Guardian had to publish an apology.\\nThe new Guardian story looked like another weak attempt to connect the alleged Russian malfeasance with Assange and the Wikileaks publishing of the DNC emails.\\nAssange and other involved people deny that such a relation existed.\\nThere is no public evidence that support such claims.\\nShortly after the Guardian\\'s fake news story went public Paul Manafort issued an unequivocal denial:\\n“I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,” the statement said.\\n“I have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks, either directly or indirectly.\\nI have never reached out to Assange or Wikileaks on any matter.\\nWe are considering all legal options against the Guardian who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false.”\\nAt 16:05 utc the Guardian silently edited the story.\\nCaveats (here in italic and underlined) were added to the headline and within several paragraphs.\\nNo editorial note was attached to inform the readers of the changes:\\nManafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy, sources say ...\\nIt is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.\\nBut the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\\n...\\nWhy Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear.\\n...\\nManafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is “100% false”.\\nHis lawyers initially declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.\\nOne paragraph was added to included Wikileaks\\' denial:\\nIn a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met.\\nAssange described the story as a hoax.\\nAt 16:30 utc, under fire from other media and journalists, the Guardian issued a statement:\\nThis story relied on a number of sources.\\nWe put these allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange\\'s representatives prior to publication.\\nNeither responded to deny the visits taking place.\\nWe have since updated the story to reflect their denials.\\nThis defensive Guardian claim is, like its story, evidently completely false.\\nWikileaks publicly denied the Guardian\\'s claims 90 minutes before the story was first published.\\nManafort asserts that his lawyers had notified the Guardian that the story was false before the Guardian \\'proceeded with the story\\'.\\nAt 21:05 utc a third version was published which included Manafort\\'s denial.\\nHalf an hour later Julian Assange instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel.\\nWikileaks opened a fund to support the lawsuit.\\nA day after the Guardian smear piece the Washington Times reported that Manafort\\'s passports, entered into evidence by the Mueller prosecution, show that he did not visit London in any of the years the Guardian claimed he was there to visit Assange.\\nThe story was completely false and the Guardian knew it was.\\nIt disregarded and left out the denials the subjects of the story had issued before it was published.\\n\\nThe Guardian has become a main outlet for British government disinformation operations aimed at defaming Russia.\\nIt smeared Assange and Snowden as Russian collaborators.\\nIt uncritically peddled the Russiagate story and the nonsensical Skripal claims which are both obviously concocted by British intelligence services.\\nThat seems to have become its main purpose.\\nAs Disobediant Media notes (emphasis in the original):\\nWhile most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the Guardian’s smear on its face, the fact that the Guardian published this piece, and that Luke Harding is still operating with even the tiniest modicum of respect as a journalist despite his history of deceit, tells us something bone-chilling about journalism.\\nIt is no accident that Luke Harding is still employed: in fact, it is because of Harding’s consistent loyalty to establishment, specifically the UK intelligence apparatus, over the truth that determines his “success” amongst legacy press outlets.\\nHarding is not a defacement or a departure from the norm, but the personification of it.\\nJonathan Cook, a former Guardian writer, makes a similar point:\\nThe truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.\\nWith this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.\\nIts job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: ...\\nThe Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence.\\nIt did what it is designed to do.\\nWe have previously shown that the Guardian even uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the Russian people.\\nIt is openly publishing Goebbels\\' cartoons and rhetoric against Europes biggest state.\\nThere is no longer any line that it does not dare to cross.\\nUnfortunately other \\'western\\' media are not much better.\\nWithin hours of being published the Guardian piece was debunked as fake news.\\nThat did not hinder other outlets to add to its smear.\\nPolitico allowed \"a former CIA officer,\" writing under a pen name, to suggest - without any evidence - that the Guardian has been duped - not by its MI5\/6 and Ecuadorian spy sources, but by Russian disinformation:\\nRather than being the bombshell smoking gun that directly connects the Trump campaign to WikiLeaks, perhaps the report is something else entirely: a disinformation campaign.\\nIs it possible someone planted this story as a means to discredit the journalists?\\n...\\nHarding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in Russia’s intelligence operation against the West’s democratic institutions.\\n...\\nIf this latest story about Manafort and Assange is false—that is, if, for example, the sources lied to Harding and Collyns (or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists), or if the Ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake, the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make Harding look bad.\\nThe is zero evidence in the Politico screed that supports its suggestions and claims.\\nIt is fake news about a fake news story.\\nIt also included the false claim that Glenn Greenwald worked with Wikileaks on the Snowden papers.\\nThat claim was later removed.\\nWe have seen a similar pattern in the Skripal affair.\\nWhen \\'western\\' intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation, they accuse Russia of being the source of the fake.\\nUnfortunately no western main stream media can any longer be trusted to publish the truth.\\nThe Guardian is only one of many which peddle smears and disinformation about the \\'enemies\\' of the ruling \\'western interests\\'.\\nIt is on all of us to debunk them and to educate the public about their scheme.\\n---\\nThis is a Moon of Alabama fundraiser week.\\nNo one pays me to write these blog posts.\\nIf you appreciated this one, or any of the 7,000+ others, please consider a donation.\\nPosted by b on November 29,

       " {'text': 'Former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States Accuses Pope of McCarrick Cover-up, Calls on Francis to Resign\\n\\nIn this tragic moment for the Church in various parts of the world — the United States, Chile, Honduras, Australia, etc.\\n— bishops have a very grave responsibility.\\nI am thinking in particular of the United States of America, where I was sent as Apostolic Nuncio by Pope Benedict XVI on October 19, 2011, the memorial feast of the First North American Martyrs.\\nThe Bishops of the United States are called, and I with them, to follow the example of these first martyrs who brought the Gospel to the lands of America, to be credible witnesses of the immeasurable love of Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life.\\nAlso, as this is an unprecedented moment in papal history, perhaps the unprecedented step of recalling Benedict XVI to the Chair of St. Peter should also be considered sooner rather than later, before this crisis gets any more out-of-control than it already is.\\nMay God save His Church MJM\\nSo serious is the cover-up that for the good of the Church and protection of the faithful, Archbishop Vigano has called on Pope Francis to resign.\\nBut before Francis resigns, we the Catholic faithful demand that he also remove from the College of Cardinals those who conspired even before the 2013 conclave to make Jorge Mario Bergoglio pope come hell or high water.\\nHe and the St. Gallen Group know exactly who they are.\\nArchbishop Carlo Maria Viganò\\'s 11-page statement, released to the National Catholic Register, accuses Pope Francis of covering for McCarrick, ignoring the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on McCarrick, and also of making McCarrick a trusted counselor who became Francis\\'s \"kingmaker\" when it came to American appointments and was highly instrumental in the Pope\\'s decision to elevate far-Left bishops such as Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark to the College of Cardinals.\\nRemnant Editor\\'s Note: This could well mark the beginning of the end of the disastrous pontificate of Pope Francis.\\nThe former apostolic nuncio to the United States has accused Francis of repealing sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI on then-Cardinal McCarrick for sexual abuse.\\nThis is a charge most serious, perhaps without precedent in modern times.\\nBishops and priests, abusing their authority, have committed horrendous crimes to the detriment of their faithful, minors, innocent victims, and young men eager to offer their lives to the Church, or by their silence have not prevented that such crimes continue to be perpetrated.\\nTo restore the beauty of holiness to the face of the Bride of Christ, which is terribly disfigured by so many abominable crimes, and if we truly want to free the Church from the fetid swamp into which she has fallen, we must have the courage to tear down the culture of secrecy and publicly confess the truths we have kept hidden.\\nWe must tear down the conspiracy of silence with which bishops and priests have protected themselves at the expense of their faithful, a conspiracy of silence that in the eyes of the world risks making the Church look like a sect, a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia.\\n“Whatever you have said in the dark ... shall be proclaimed from the housetops” (Lk.\\n12:3).\\nI had always believed and hoped that the hierarchy of the Church could find within itself the spiritual resources and strength to tell the whole truth, to amend and to renew itself.\\nThat is why, even though I had repeatedly been asked to do so, I always avoided making statements to the media, even when it would have been my right to do so, in order to defend myself against the calumnies published about me, even by high-ranking prelates of the Roman Curia.\\nBut now that the corruption has reached the very top of the Church’s hierarchy, my conscience dictates that I reveal those truths regarding the heart-breaking case of the Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C., Theodore McCarrick, which I came to know in the course of the duties entrusted to me by St. John Paul II, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, from 1998 to 2009, and by Pope Benedict XVI, as Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America, from October 19, 2011 until end of May 2016.\\nAs Delegate for Pontifical Representations in the Secretariat of State, my responsibilities were not limited to the Apostolic Nunciatures, but also included the staff of the Roman Curia (hires, promotions, informational processes on candidates to the episcopate, etc.)\\nand the examination of delicate cases, including those regarding cardinals and bishops, that were entrusted to the Delegate by the Cardinal Secretary of State or by the Substitute of the Secretariat of State.\\nTo dispel suspicions insinuated in several recent articles, I will immediately say that the Apostolic Nuncios in the United States, Gabriel Montalvo and Pietro Sambi, both prematurely deceased, did not fail to inform the Holy See immediately, as soon as they learned of Archbishop McCarrick’s gravely immoral behavior with seminarians and priests.\\nIndeed, according to what Nuncio Pietro Sambi wrote, Father Boniface Ramsey, O.P.’s letter, dated November 22, 2000, was written at the request of the late Nuncio Montalvo.\\nIn the letter, Father Ramsey, who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in Newark from the end of the ’80s until 1996, affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the Archbishop “shared his bed with seminarians,” inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house.\\nAnd he added that he knew a certain number of seminarians, some of whom were later ordained priests for the Archdiocese of Newark, who had been invited to this beach house and had shared a bed with the Archbishop.\\nThe office that I held at the time was not informed of any measure taken by the Holy See after those charges were brought by Nuncio Montalvo at the end of 2000, when Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State.\\nLikewise, Nuncio Sambi transmitted to the Cardinal Secretary of State, Tarcisio Bertone, an Indictment Memorandum against McCarrick by the priest Gregory Littleton of the diocese of Charlotte, who was reduced to the lay state for a violation of minors, together with two documents from the same Littleton, in which he recounted his tragic story of sexual abuse by the then-Archbishop of Newark and several other priests and seminarians.\\nThe Nuncio added that Littleton had already forwarded his Memorandum to about twenty people, including civil and ecclesiastical judicial authorities, police and lawyers, in June 2006, and that it was therefore very likely that the news would soon be made public.\\nHe therefore called for a prompt intervention by the Holy See.\\nIn writing up a memo[1] on these documents that were entrusted to me, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, on December 6, 2006, I wrote to my superiors, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone and the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, that the facts attributed to McCarrick by Littleton were of such gravity and vileness as to provoke bewilderment, a sense of disgust, deep sorrow and bitterness in the reader, and that they constituted the crimes of seducing, requesting depraved acts of seminarians and priests, repeatedly and simultaneously with several people, derision of a young seminarian who tried to resist the Archbishop’s seductions in the presence of two other priests, absolution of the accomplices in these depraved acts, sacrilegious celebration of the Eucharist with the same priests after committing such acts.\\nIn my memo, which I delivered on that same December 6, 2006 to my direct superior, the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, I proposed the following considerations and course of action to my superiors:\\n- Given that it seemed a new scandal of particular gravity, as it regarded a cardinal, was going to be added to the many scandals for the Church in the United States,\\n- and that, since this matter had to do with a cardinal, and according to can.\\n1405 § 1, No.\\n2˚, “ipsius Romani Pontificis dumtaxat ius est iudicandi”;\\n- I proposed that an exemplary measure be taken against the Cardinal that could have a medicinal function, to prevent future abuses against innocent victims and alleviate the very serious scandal for the faithful, who despite everything continued to love and believe in the Church.\\nI added that it would be salutary if, for once, ecclesiastical authority would intervene before the civil authorities and, if possible, before the scandal had broken out in the press.\\nThis could have restored some dignity to a Church so sorely tried and humiliated by so many abominable acts on the part of some pastors.\\nIf this were done, the civil authority would no longer have to judge a cardinal, but a pastor with whom the Church had already taken appropriate measures to prevent the cardinal from abusing his authority and continuing to destroy innocent victims.\\nMy memo of December 6, 2006 was kept by my superiors, and was never returned to me with any actual decision by the superiors on this matter.\\nSubsequently, around April 21-23, 2008, the Statement for Pope Benedict XVI about the pattern of sexual abuse crisis in the United States, by Richard Sipe, was published on the internet, at richardsipe.com.\\nOn April 24, it was passed on by the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal William Levada, to the Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone.\\nIt was delivered to me one month later, on May 24, 2008.\\nThe following day, I delivered a new memo to the new Substitute, Fernando Filoni, which included my previous one of December 6, 2006.\\nIn it, I summarized Richard Sipe’s document, which ended with this respectful and heartfelt appeal to Pope Benedict XVI: “I approach Your Holiness with due reverence, but with the same intensity that motivated Peter Damian to lay out before your predecessor, Pope Leo IX, a description of the condition of the clergy during his time.\\nThe problems he spoke of are similar and as great now in the United States as they were then in Rome.\\nIf Your Holiness requests, I will personally submit to you documentation of that about which I have spoken.”\\nI ended my memo by repeating to my superiors that I thought it was necessary to intervene as soon as possible by removing the cardinal’s hat from Cardinal McCarrick and that he should be subjected to the sanctions established by the Code of Canon Law, which also provide for reduction to the lay state.\\nThis second memo of mine was also never returned to the Personnel Office, and I was greatly dismayed at my superiors for the inconceivable absence of any measure against the Cardinal, and for the continuing lack of any communication with me since my first memo in December 2006.\\nBut finally I learned with certainty, through Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, that Richard Sipe’s courageous and meritorious Statement had had the desired result.\\nPope Benedict had imposed on Cardinal McCarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by Pope Francis: the Cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.\\nI do not know when Pope Benedict took these measures against McCarrick, whether in 2009 or 2010, because in the meantime I had been transferred to the Governorate of Vatican City State, just as I do not know who was responsible for this incredible delay.\\nI certainly do not believe it was Pope Benedict, who as Cardinal had repeatedly denounced the corruption present in the Church, and in the first months of his pontificate had already taken a firm stand against the admission into seminary of young men with deep homosexual tendencies.\\nI believe it was due to the Pope’s first collaborator at the time, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who notoriously favored promoting homosexuals into positions of responsibility, and was accustomed to managing the information he thought appropriate to convey to the Pope.\\nIn any case, what is certain is that Pope Benedict imposed the above canonical sanctions on McCarrick and that they were communicated to him by the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi.\\nMonsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, then first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington and Chargé d\\'Affaires a.i.\\nafter the unexpected death of Nuncio Sambi in Baltimore, told me when I arrived in Washington — and he is ready to testify to it— about a stormy conversation, lasting over an hour, that Nuncio Sambi had with Cardinal McCarrick whom he had summoned to the Nunciature.\\nMonsignor Lantheaume told me that “the Nuncio’s voice could be heard all the way out in the corridor.”\\nPope Benedict’s same dispositions were then also communicated to me by the new Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, in November 2011, in a conversation before my departure for Washington, and were included among the instructions of the same Congregation to the new Nuncio.\\nIn turn, I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.\\nThe Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.\\nThe faithful insistently wonder how it was possible for him to be appointed to Washington, and as Cardinal, and they have every right to know who knew, and who covered up his grave misdeeds.\\nIt is therefore my duty to reveal what I know about this, beginning with the Roman Curia.\\nCardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information was communicated to him.\\nIn November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.\\nIt is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.\\nHe even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.\\nSodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.\\nBenedict reacted, despite Sodano’s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.\\nWas McCarrick’s appointment to Washington and as Cardinal the work of Sodano, when John Paul II was already very ill?\\nWe are not given to know.\\nHowever, it is legitimate to think so, but I do not think he was the only one responsible for this.\\nMcCarrick frequently went to Rome and made friends everywhere, at all levels of the Curia.\\nIf Sodano had protected Maciel, as seems certain, there is no reason why he wouldn’t have done so for McCarrick, who according to many had the financial means to influence decisions.\\nHis nomination to Washington was opposed by then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.\\nAt the Nunciature in Washington there is a note, written in his hand, in which Cardinal Re disassociates himself from the appointment and states that McCarrick was 14th on the list for Washington.\\nNuncio Sambi’s report, with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.\\nMy two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.\\nAs already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals — I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians — and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict.\\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, the current Secretary of State, was also complicit in covering up the misdeeds of McCarrick who had, after the election of Pope Francis, boasted openly of his travels and missions to various continents.\\nIn April 2014, the Washington Times had a front page report on McCarrick’s trip to the Central African Republic, and on behalf of the State Department no less.\\nAs Nuncio to Washington, I wrote to Cardinal Parolin asking him if the sanctions imposed on McCarrick by Pope Benedict were still valid.\\nÇa va sans dire that my letter never received any reply!\\nThe same can be said for Cardinal William Levada, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for Cardinals Marc Ouellet, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Lorenzo Baldisseri, former Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops, and Archbishop Ilson de Jesus Montanari, current Secretary of the same Congregation.\\nThey were all aware by reason of their office of the sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict on McCarrick.\\nCardinals Leonardo Sandri, Fernando Filoni and Angelo Becciu, as Substitutes of the Secretariat of State, knew in every detail the situation regarding Cardinal McCarrick.\\nNor could Cardinals Giovanni Lajolo and Dominique Mamberti have failed to know.\\nAs Secretaries for Relations with States, they participated several times a week in collegial meetings with the Secretary of State.\\nAs far as the Roman Curia is concerned, for the moment I will stop here, even if the names of other prelates in the Vatican are well known, even some very close to Pope Francis, such as Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio and Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who belong to the homosexual current in favor of subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality, a current already denounced in 1986 by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then-Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in the Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons.\\nCardinals Edwin Frederick O’Brien and Renato Raffaele Martino also belong to the same current, albeit with a different ideology.\\nOthers belonging to this current even reside at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.\\nNow to the United States.\\nObviously, the first to have been informed of the measures taken by Pope Benedict was McCarrick’s successor in Washington See, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, whose situation is now completely compromised by the recent revelations regarding his behavior as Bishop of Pittsburgh.\\nIt is absolutely unthinkable that Nunzio Sambi, who was an extremely responsible person, loyal, direct and explicit in his way of being (a true son of Romagna) did not speak to him about it.\\nIn any case, I myself brought up the subject with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.\\nI also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.\\nI immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.\\nIf, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?\\nHis recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable.\\nThe Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well.\\nCardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.\\nFollowing a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.\\nBefore forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.\\nThe Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.\\nHowever, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did.\\nI subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.\\nBut the Cardinal knew nothing about it!\\nCardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.\\nIn doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.\\nBishop Paul Bootkoski, emeritus of Metuchen, and Archbishop John Myers, emeritus of Newark, covered up the abuses committed by McCarrick in their respective dioceses and compensated two of his victims.\\nThey cannot deny it and they must be interrogated in order to reveal every circumstance and all responsibility regarding this matter.\\nCardinal Kevin Farrell, who was recently interviewed by the media, also said that he didn’t have the slightest idea about the abuses committed by McCarrick.\\nGiven his tenure in Washington, Dallas and now Rome, I think no one can honestly believe him.\\nI don’t know if he was ever asked if he knew about Maciel’s crimes.\\nIf he were to deny this, would anybody believe him given that he occupied positions of responsibility as a member of the Legionaries of Christ?\\nRegarding Cardinal Sean O’Malley, I would simply say that his latest statements on the McCarrick case are disconcerting, and have totally obscured his transparency and credibility.\\n* * *\\nMy conscience requires me also to reveal facts that I have experienced personally, concerning Pope Francis, that have a dramatic significance, which as Bishop, sharing the collegial responsibility of all the bishops for the universal Church, do not allow me to remain silent, and that I state here, ready to reaffirm them under oath by calling on God as my witness.\\nIn the last months of his pontificate, Pope Benedict XVI had convened a meeting of all the apostolic nuncios in Rome, as Paul VI and St. John Paul II had done on several occasions.\\nThe date set for the audience with the Pope was Friday, June 21, 2013.\\nPope Francis kept this commitment made by his predecessor.\\nOf course I also came to Rome from Washington.\\nIt was my first meeting with the new Pope elected only three months prior, after the resignation of Pope Benedict.\\nOn the morning of Thursday, June 20, 2013, I went to the Domus Sanctae Marthae, to join my colleagues who were staying there.\\nAs soon as I entered the hall I met Cardinal McCarrick, who wore the red-trimmed cassock.\\nI greeted him respectfully as I had always done.\\nHe immediately said to me, in a tone somewhere between ambiguous and triumphant: “The Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China.”\\nAt the time I knew nothing of his long friendship with Cardinal Bergoglio and of the important part he had played in his recent election, as McCarrick himself would later reveal in a lecture at Villanova University and in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter.\\nNor had I ever thought of the fact that he had participated in the preliminary meetings of the recent conclave, and of the role he had been able to have as a cardinal elector in the 2005 conclave.\\nTherefore I did not immediately grasp the meaning of the encrypted message that McCarrick had communicated to me, but that would become clear to me in the days immediately following.\\nThe next day the audience with Pope Francis took place.\\nAfter his address, which was partly read and partly delivered off the cuff, the Pope wished to greet all the nuncios one by one.\\nIn single file, I remember that I was among the last.\\nWhen it was my turn, I just had time to say to him, “I am the Nuncio to the United States.” He immediately assailed me with a tone of reproach, using these words: “The Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized!\\nThey must be shepherds!”Of course I was not in a position to ask for explanations about the meaning of his words and the aggressive way in which he had upbraided me.\\nI had in my hand a book in Portuguese that Cardinal O’Malley had sent me for the Pope a few days earlier, telling me “so he could go over his Portuguese before going to Rio for World Youth Day.” I handed it to him immediately, and so freed myself from that extremely disconcerting and embarrassing situation.\\nAt the end of the audience the Pope announced: “Those of you who are still in Rome next Sunday are invited to concelebrate with me at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.” I naturally thought of staying on to clarify as soon as possible what the Pope intended to tell me.\\nOn Sunday June 23, before the concelebration with the Pope, I asked Monsignor Ricca, who as the person in charge of the house helped us put on the vestments, if he could ask the Pope if he could receive me sometime in the following week.\\nHow could I have returned to Washington without having clarified what the Pope wanted of me?\\nAt the end of Mass, while the Pope was greeting the few lay people present, Monsignor Fabian Pedacchio, his Argentine secretary, came to me and said: “The Pope told me to ask if you are free now!” Naturally, I replied that I was at the Pope’s disposal and that I thanked him for receiving me immediately.\\nThe Pope took me to the first floor in his apartment and said: “We have 40 minutes before the Angelus.”\\nI began the conversation, asking the Pope what he intended to say to me with the words he had addressed to me when I greeted him the previous Friday.\\nAnd the Pope, in a very different, friendly, almost affectionate tone, said to me: “Yes, the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing like the Archbishop of Philadelphia, (the Pope did not give me the name of the Archbishop) they must be shepherds; and they must not be left-wing — and he added, raising both arms — and when I say left-wing I mean homosexual.” Of course, the logic of the correlation between being left-wing and being homosexual escaped me, but I added nothing else.\\nImmediately after, the Pope asked me in a deceitful way: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.\\nHe corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.” The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject.\\nBut then, what was the Pope’s purpose in asking me that question: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not.\\nBack in Washington everything became very clear to me, thanks also to a new event that occurred only a few days after my meeting with Pope Francis.\\nWhen the new Bishop Mark Seitz took possession of the Diocese of El Paso on July 9, 2013, I sent the first Counsellor, Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, while I went to Dallas that same day for an international meeting on Bioethics.\\nWhen he got back, Monsignor Lantheaume told me that in El Paso he had met Cardinal McCarrick who, taking him aside, told him almost the same words that the Pope had said to me in Rome: “the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing, they must be shepherds….” I was astounded!\\nIt was therefore clear that the words of reproach that Pope Francis had addressed to me on June 21, 2013 had been put into his mouth the day before by Cardinal McCarrick.\\nAlso the Pope’s mention “not like the Archbishop of Philadelphia” could be traced to McCarrick, because there had been a strong disagreement between the two of them about the admission to Communion of pro-abortion politicians.\\nIn his communication to the bishops, McCarrick had manipulated a letter of then-Cardinal Ratzinger who prohibited giving them Communion.\\nIndeed, I also knew how certain Cardinals such as Mahony, Levada and Wuerl, were closely linked to McCarrick; they had opposed the most recent appointments made by Pope Benedict, for important posts such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Denver and San Francisco.\\nNot happy with the trap he had set for me on June 23, 2013, when he asked me about McCarrick, only a few months later, in the audience he granted me on October 10, 2013, Pope Francis set a second one for me, this time concerning a second of his protégés, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.\\nHe asked me: “What is Cardinal Wuerl like, is he good or bad?” I replied, “Holy Father, I will not tell you if he is good or bad, but I will tell you two facts.” They are the ones I have already mentioned above, which concern Wuerl’s pastoral carelessness regarding the aberrant deviations at Georgetown University and the invitation by the Archdiocese of Washington to young aspirants to the priesthood to a meeting with McCarrick!\\nOnce again the Pope did not show any reaction.\\nIt was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews.\\nIn a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, he had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration.\\nThis is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.\\nWith these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops.\\nIn addition, he appointed the Brazilian Ilson de Jesus Montanari — the great friend of his private Argentine secretary Fabian Pedacchio — as Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops and Secretary of the College of Cardinals, promoting him in one single leap from a simple official of that department to Archbishop Secretary.\\nSomething unprecedented for such an important position!\\nThe appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two.\\nTheir names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.\\nRegarding Cupich, one cannot fail to note his ostentatious arrogance, and the insolence with which he denies the evidence that is now obvious to all: that 80% of the abuses found were committed against young adults by homosexuals who were in a relationship of authority over their victims.\\nDuring the speech he gave when he took possession of the Chicago See, at which I was present as a representative of the Pope, Cupich quipped that one certainly should not expect the new Archbishop to walk on water.\\nPerhaps it would be enough for him to be able to remain with his feet on the ground and not try to turn reality upside-down, blinded by his pro-gay ideology, as he stated in a recent interview with America Magazine.\\nExtolling his particular expertise in the matter, having been President of the Committee on Protection of Children and Young People of the USCCB, he asserted that the main problem in the crisis of sexual abuse by clergy is not homosexuality, and that affirming this is only a way of diverting attention from the real problem which is clericalism.\\nIn support of this thesis, Cupich “oddly” made reference to the results of research carried out at the height of the sexual abuse of minors crisis in the early 2000s, while he “candidly” ignored that the results of that investigation were totally denied by the subsequent Independent Reports by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2004 and 2011, which concluded that, in cases of sexual abuse, 81% of the victims were male.\\nIn fact, Father Hans Zollner, S.J., Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, President of the Centre for Child Protection, and Member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, recently told the newspaper La Stampa that “in most cases it is a question of homosexual abuse.”\\nThe appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: “Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.” McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick’s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.\\nThese characters are closely associated with individuals belonging in particular to the deviated wing of the Society of Jesus, unfortunately today a majority, which had already been a cause of serious concern to Paul VI and subsequent pontiffs.\\nWe need only consider Father Robert Drinan, S.J., who was elected four times to the House of Representatives, and was a staunch supporter of abortion; or Father Vincent O’Keefe, S.J., one of the principal promoters of The Land O’Lakes Statement of 1967, which seriously compromised the Catholic identity of universities and colleges in the United States.\\nIt should be noted that McCarrick, then President of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, also participated in that inauspicious undertaking which was so harmful to the formation of the consciences of American youth, closely associated as it was with the deviated wing of the Jesuits.\\nFather James Martin, S.J., acclaimed by the people mentioned above, in particular Cupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy, appointed Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications, well-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families, is nothing but a sad recent example of that deviated wing of the Society of Jesus.\\nPope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church and for bishops and faithful to act with parrhesia.\\nThe faithful throughout the world also demand this of him in an exemplary manner.\\nHe must honestly state when he first learned about the crimes committed by McCarrick, who abused his authority with seminarians and priests.\\nIn any case, the Pope learned about it from me on June 23, 2013 and continued to cover for him.\\nHe did not take into account the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on him and made him his trusted counselor along with Maradiaga.\\nThe latter [Maradiaga] is so confident of the Pope’s protection that he can dismiss as “gossip” the heartfelt appeals of dozens of his seminarians, who found the courage to write to him after one of them tried to commit suicide over homosexual abuse in the seminary.\\nBy now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga’s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See.\\nIn the case of the former Auxiliary Bishop Juan José Pineda, after the article published in the [Italian] weekly L’Espresso last February, Maradiaga stated in the newspaper Avvenire: “It was my auxiliary bishop Pineda who asked for the visitation, so as to ‘clear’ his name after being subjected to much slander.” Now, regarding Pineda the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.\\nIn the name of the transparency so hailed by the Pope, the report that the Visitator, Argentine bishop Alcides Casaretto, delivered more than a year ago only and directly to the Pope, must be made public.\\nFinally, the recent appointment as Substitute of Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra is also connected with Honduras, that is, with Maradiaga.\\nFrom 2003 to 2007 Peña Parra worked as Counsellor at the Tegucigalpa Nunciature.\\nAs Delegate for Pontifical Representations I received worrisome information about him.\\nIn Honduras, a scandal as huge as the one in Chile is about to be repeated.\\nThe Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.\\nFirst he insulted the abuse victims.\\nThen, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.\\nEven in the tragic affair of McCarrick, Pope Francis’s behavior was no different.\\nHe knew from at least June 23, 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator.\\nAlthough he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick’s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church.\\nIt was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action [regarding McCarrick] to save his image in the media.\\nNow in the United States a chorus of voices is rising especially from the lay faithful, and has recently been joined by several bishops and priests, asking that all those who, by their silence, covered up McCarrick’s criminal behavior, or who used him to advance their career or promote their intentions, ambitions and power in the Church, should resign.\\nBut this will not be enough to heal the situation of extremely grave immoral behavior by the clergy: bishops and priests.\\nA time of conversion and penance must be proclaimed.\\nThe virtue of chastity must be recovered in the clergy and in seminaries.\\nCorruption in the misuse of the Church’s resources and of the offerings of the faithful must be fought against.\\nThe seriousness of homosexual behavior must be denounced.\\nThe homosexual networks present in the Church must be eradicated, as Janet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote.\\n“The problem of clergy abuse,” she wrote, “cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives.\\nThe deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.” These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.\\nI implore everyone, especially Bishops, to speak up in order to defeat this conspiracy of silence that is so widespread, and to report the cases of abuse they know about to the media and civil authorities.\\nLet us heed the most powerful message that St. John Paul II left us as an inheritance:Do not be afraid!\\nDo not be afraid!\\nIn his 2008 homily on the Feast of the Epiphany, Pope Benedict reminded us that the Father’s plan of salvation had been fully revealed and realized in the mystery of Christ’s death and resurrection, but it needs to be welcomed in human history, which is always a history of fidelity on God’s part and unfortunately also of infidelity on the part of us men.\\nThe Church, the depositary of the blessing of the New Covenant, signed in the blood of the Lamb, is holy but made up of sinners, as Saint Ambrose wrote: the Church is “immaculata ex maculatis,” she is holy and spotless even though, in her earthly journey, she is made up of men stained with sin.\\nI want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church’s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick; by the grave, disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors, and who are tempted to abandon the Church, disfigured by so many ignominies.\\nAt the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: “Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ...\\nIf we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it.\\nWe need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.” If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church’s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt.\\nHe followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick.\\nAnd how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!\\nFrancis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.\\nIndeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ’s flock.\\nIn this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick’s abuses and resign along with all of them.\\nEven in dismay and sadness over the enormity of what is happening, let us not lose hope!\\nWe well know that the great majority of our pastors live their priestly vocation with fidelity and dedication.\\nIt is in moments of great trial that the Lord’s grace is revealed in abundance and makes His limitless mercy available to all; but it is granted only to those who are truly repentant and sincerely propose to amend their lives.\\nThis is a favorable time for the Church to confess her sins, to convert, and to do penance.\\nLet us all pray for the Church and for the Pope, let us remember how many times he has asked us to pray for him!\\nLet us all renew faith in the Church our Mother: “I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church!”\\nChrist will never abandon His Church!\\nHe generated her in His Blood and continually revives her with His Spirit!\\nMary, Mother of the Church, pray for us!\\nMary, Virgin and Queen, Mother of the King of glory, pray for us!\\nRome, August 22, 2018\\nQueenship of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\nOfficial translation by Diane Montagna.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Has Trump Opened the Door?\\n\\nSagacious gun owners have always known that the ultimate goal of gun control extremists such as Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, et al., has always been gun confiscation.\\nThe plan is not to “control” the private ownership of firearms; it is to PROHIBIT the private ownership of firearms.\\nEnacting ever-encroaching gun control laws is simply an incremental means to the ultimate end of gun confiscation and prohibition.\\nDonald Trump was elected on the promise of protecting the Second Amendment (among other things).\\nInstead, he has become the poster boy for one of the most egregious gun control machinations of all: gun confiscation.\\nAs I reported in this column last week, in a bipartisan meeting with congressmen and senators recently, President Trump “voiced support for confiscating guns from certain individuals deemed to be dangerous, even if it violates due process rights.\\n“‘I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida … to go to court would have taken a long time,’ Trump said at a meeting with lawmakers on school safety and gun violence.\\n“‘Take the guns first, go through due process second,’ Trump said.\\n“Trump was responding to comments from Vice President Pence that families and local law enforcement should have more tools to report potentially dangerous individuals with weapons.\\n“‘Allow due process so no one’s rights are trampled, but the ability to go to court, obtain an order and then collect not only the firearms but any weapons,’ Pence said.\\n“‘Or, Mike, take the firearms first, and then go to court,’ Trump responded.”\\nSee the column here:\\nFlorida School Massacre Proves Police Are Worthless In Protecting Us\\nWell, Trump’s statements are now the rallying cry for gun grabbers all over America to enact gun confiscation laws.\\nSo far, five states have passed “red flag” laws that allow police agencies to confiscate guns from someone deemed to be “dangerous” by either a law enforcement officer or a family member BEFORE the individual has committed any crime, and in one State (Rhode Island) the governor issued an executive order implementing a “red flag” law.\\nHere are the six states where the legislatures have already passed—or the governor has already issued an executive order implementing—“red flag” laws:\\nCalifornia\\nConnecticut\\nIndiana\\nOregon\\nWashington\\nRhode Island\\nAnd since Trump’s Stalinist statements, there are at least 24 additional states that are currently considering passing “red flag” laws.\\nThese are:\\nAlabama\\nAlaska\\nArizona\\nDelaware\\nFlorida\\nHawaii\\nIllinois\\nIowa\\nKansas\\nKentucky\\nMaryland\\nMassachusetts\\nMichigan\\nMinnesota\\nMissouri\\nNew Jersey\\nNew York\\nNorth Carolina\\nOhio\\nPennsylvania\\nTennessee\\nUtah\\nVermont\\nVirginia\\nAnd it’s not taking long for law enforcement agencies in the above states to begin their Naziesque assault on gun owners.\\nThis report is from Seattle:Doubtless, many other states are also considering passing “red flag” laws.\\n“The city’s police department became the first law enforcement agency in the state to force the surrender of a firearm under a new law known as an ‘extreme risk protection order.’\\n“The incident involves a man who lives in Belltown, who neighbors said had been intimidating people for the past year – even staring-down customers through store-front windows with a gun holstered at his side.\\n“Mental illness is suspected, but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him.”\\n“The man, who we are not naming, is also well known to the bars and restaurants below his unit along Second Ave.\\nThe volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order – or ‘erpo’ – which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.\\n“In this case, the man refused to comply.\\nBecause of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.”\\n“A few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over.\\n“Law enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings – such as what happened in Parkland, Florida.\\n“‘There’s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms.\\nThe “erpos” give us that tool now as an option,’ said Sgt.\\nEric Pisconski, who leads the crisis response unit for the Seattle Police Department.\\n“The confiscations only last a year, although they can be renewed.”\\nSee the report here:\\nSeattle Police First In State To Seize Gun Under Mental Health Law\\nA few observations are in order here:\\nFirst, the open carry of a firearm is LEGAL in the area where this took place.\\nSo, the fellow was violating NO gun laws whatsoever.\\nPlus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way.\\nSecondly, the man was “known” to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence.\\nThat means nothing.\\nKnown for what?\\nThe report doesn’t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely.\\nIt just says he was “known.” And even if he did act weirdly or strangely, if we denied constitutional rights to everyone in that category, a majority of Americans would have no rights, and ALL of Congress would have no rights.\\nThirdly, what does “volume of complaints” mean?\\nHow many complaints were received over a YEAR’S time?\\nTwo?\\nFive?\\nTen?\\nPeople complaining about other people happens all of the time.\\nPlus, if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act, the man must not have been considered much of a threat.\\nFourthly, there was NO report of the man “exhibiting violent behavior,” as the police sergeant claims.\\nThe report says “he had been intimidating people.” How?\\nNo specifics except to say he was “staring” at people.\\nWow!\\nRun for your lives!\\nFifthly, a U.S. citizen who has committed NO CRIME is denied his Natural right of self-defense for a whole year.\\nAnd the media report says the confiscations “only” last a year, with the caveat that they may be extended.\\nIndeed.\\nThey could and very likely will be extended indefinitely.\\nHow many defenseless (unarmed) people are robbed, assaulted, accosted, beaten up, raped, wounded, paralyzed, or killed in a year’s time?\\nIt seems many politicians (and many police officers themselves) will not be content until every American citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself.\\nI tell you this with all seriousness: At some point, the American people will be forced to view these governmental attacks against our Second Amendment liberties as a declaration of war.\\nSixthly, the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he didn’t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm, as it made him “afraid.”\\nSO WHAT?\\nThat the mere sight of a law-abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone “afraid” is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and “bear” arms.\\nThis “I’m offended” or “his gun scares me” complaint is nothing but cover for little Nazis to try and deny another person their Natural, God-given liberty.\\nBut under this new “red flag” law in Washington State, police are now able to confiscate a person’s firearm without the person committing ANY crime—or even threatening to commit a crime.\\nEven when police forced the man to surrender his firearm, the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers.\\nGun confiscation has started in America—and President Trump’s Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later is the banner under which this is happening.\\nWhen Trump promised to add “mental health” regulations to gun purchases and ownership, he opened Pandora’s Box.\\nI go into the “mental health” trap in more detail in this column:\\nTrump Set To Enact More Gun Control\\n“Mental health” regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers Schumer, Pelosi, Feinstein, et al., have been trying to accomplish for decades.\\nNow, it is the “pro-gun” Republican President Donald Trump who is the one making it happen.\\nKris Kobach is the Secretary of State of Kansas.\\nHe is a former professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School.\\nHe wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these “red flag” laws:\\nThe seizure of guns without any hearing at all.\\nThe laws all contain an “ex parte” provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person’s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard.\\nThis is the quintessential denial of due process.\\nThe Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one’s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law.\\nThis confiscation is “temporary,” but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation.\\nBased on the testimony of one unrelated person.\\nThe confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others.\\nThe law deceptively says that it has to be the testimony of a “family member.” [Most of the “red flag” laws, such as the one in Washington State, do not limit who can claim the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others to family members.]\\nBut “family member” is defined to include “former dating partners” and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant.\\nSo a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner.\\nUsing a very low standard of proof.\\nThe standard for obtaining an ex parte order against a gun owner is absurdly low – one need only show “reasonable cause” to believe that the person may pose a risk.\\nThat’s even lower than the “probable cause” standard for obtaining a search warrant.\\nIn addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing.\\nWithin two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order.\\nBut even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal trials.\\nRather, it need only be shown by “a preponderance of evidence” that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others.\\nWhat kind of evidence?\\nThings like the “reckless storage” of firearms and drinking habits can be considered.\\nIf you keep a handgun in the bedside table and drink beer regularly, you may [be] in trouble.\\nShifting the burden of proof to the gun owner.\\nThe long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely.\\nOnce it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove.\\nTo have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others.\\nProving a negative is nearly impossible.\\nAdding insult to injury, the bill even authorizes local law enforcement to charge the gun owner a storage fee for confiscating and storing his guns.\\nAfter the Parkland school shooting, had Donald Trump simply used his bully pulpit to promote arming teachers and school employees as a deterrent and defense against these school shootings without calling for more gun control, it would have been a HUGE boost for the Second Amendment in general and school safety in particular.\\nInstead, Trump fell in with anti-Second Amendment liberals and started calling for more gun control, adding “mental health” restrictions to gun purchases and making his stupid Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later.\\nAs a result, anti-gun liberals all over the country are using Trump’s own words and proposed gun control policies as a rallying cry to enact gun confiscation laws.\\nAs it stands right now, Donald Trump has opened the door for more damage being done to the Second Amendment than any other president, Democrat or Republican, in our lifetime.\\nFreedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their State legislatures this year and next, because, thanks to Donald Trump, gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single State in the country.\\nAnd while you are at it, don’t overlook the federal Congress.\\nNo wonder Dianne Feinstein looked so deliriously (and devilishly) happy when Trump uttered his stupid comment about gun confiscation and said he wanted to bring an assault weapons ban (Feinstein’s bill) into proposed gun control legislation.\\nSee the video here:\\nWatch Dianne Feinstein Erupt With Glee After Trump Seems To Endorse Her Assault Weapons Ban\\nBut if you are a freedom-loving American who values your liberties and the God-given right to defend them, happy is NOT what you should be feeling right now.\\nYou should be OUTRAGED at Donald Trump, and you should be absolutely determined to be ever vigilant against ANY attempt from Democrats or Republicans from federal, State, or municipal government to enact further restrictions against your right to keep and bear arms—because Trump has opened the door not only for more gun control but also for gun confiscation.\\nP.S.\\nOne more time I want to remind readers that self-defense—including defense against tyrannical government—is more than a right guaranteed in the Second Amendment to our Constitution; it is a duty assigned us in Nature by our Creator.\\nFor anyone, especially a Christian, to willingly surrender their means of self-defense is not only a crime against liberty; it is a sin against God.\\nI urge my Christian friends (and anyone else) to read the book my constitutional attorney son and I wrote entitled “To Keep or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.”\\nMark it down: Any law demanding the citizenry to surrender their AR-15 rifles would be unconstitutional, unnatural, and unbiblical.\\nAnd NO Christian or other free man should ever comply with such a law.\\nI know that there is a plethora of pastors who teach that Christians ought to obey the government should it outlaw our guns.\\nTHEY ARE WRONG.\\nThey are wrong biblically, constitutionally, and morally.\\nOur book shows the Natural and Biblical duty of self-defense.\\nI don’t know of another book like it.\\nWith all that is happening today, it is CRUCIAL that people (especially Christians) become familiar with the truths contained in this book.\\nI urge you to order one for yourself and one (at least) for your friends and kinfolk.\\nReprinted with permission from Chuck Baldwin.\\nThe Best of Chuck Baldwin\\n',\n",

       " {'text': \"Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions\\n\\nNewsCatholic Church\\nSALZBURG, Austria, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – The indignation about Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode – the President and the Vice President of the German Bishops' Conference – and their direct or more indirect encouragement of blessing homosexual unions is growing by the day.\\nNow Bishop emeritus Andreas Laun – one of the signatories of the Kazakh “Profession of Truth about Sacramental Marriage” – has written a strong commentary for the Austrian Catholic news website Kath.net on the recent episcopal initiatives coming out of Germany.\\nIn the following, we shall present to our readers the essential parts of Bishop Laun's statement, in our English translation from the German.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No!\\nAnd your addition “in individual cases” is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force.\\nA clear statement by Bishop Andreas Laun for Kath.net.\\nCardinal Marx and also Bishop Bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing.\\nWhy not, one could say, since the Church is ready to bless nearly everything on the earth?\\nNow, the Church especially blesses people, but also deeds and objects.\\nThe Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings:\\nFor Catholics, really everything can be blessed, not only places of worship, chalices, and the faithful after each prayer service – whether after a Mass, or after the prayers for the hours of the day.\\nThe blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal, but one may also bless cars, factory halls, animals, herbs, and much more.\\nSome blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons, especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments.\\nBut parents can bless their children.\\nThe faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family, but also the stable and the animals, thus blessing them.\\n[...]\\nWhat kind of hope is connected with a blessing?\\nWith regard to the car, certainly the wish for heavenly protection – sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of car drivers.\\nWith the weather blessing, one prays explicitly for protection against hail, lightning and drought.\\n[…]\\nTo bless always means that something shall flourish, because only then when there is a blessing upon a cause or a project, will something good come out of it.\\nThe blessing comes from God, He is being addressed in the form of a request; and it is given to people, objects, and buildings, with the help of the sign of the cross, holy water, and incense.\\n[…]\\nBut now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx, and not a few of the priests, the answer is simple: one may ask for God's blessing for sinners, but not for the sin.\\nThat is to say, one could not consecrate a brothel, one could not bless a concentration camp or weapons which are not explicitly ordained for hunting or for legitimate self-defense.\\nTherefore it is clear that one may not bless a relationship which is sinful; [one may not bless] the mafia; no blessing for organizations or institutions which promote or procure abortions or which propagate ideologies which are against the Faith, antisemitic contents, or other forms of racist thought.\\nIf one considers and weighs this matter, one knows: one may not bless a union of two homosexual men or of lesbian women.\\nOf course [one could bless] two men or women who are de facto homosexual, and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them.\\nThis blessing – which is not related to their acts – is being received also by all the other sinners, and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God's Grace!\\nThis position which is really simple and easily to be understood has been clearly and convincingly presented – since the statement of the two bishops [Marx and Bode] – by several Christians: by Archbishops Ludwig Schick (Germany) and Charles Chaput (USA); by the German-speaking theologians Hubert Windisch and Markus Büning.\\nI am sure there are many many others, too, who think alike, but whom I do not know.\\nDear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No!\\nAnd your addition “in individual cases” is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force.\\nWhat would St. John the Baptist have said if Herod, taking for himself his brother's wife, would have excusingly called himself an “individual case”!\\nThe idea to bless sinful conduct is really what Isaiah described quite vividly, as follows: “Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.” [Isaiah 5:20]\\nIs this not exactly what Cardinal Marx – and others who are thinking like him – are doing?\\nIf one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag “honey,” the cucumbers still remain sour!\\nEven blessing bishops cannot change that.\\nNor can the pope, in calling for a cultural revolution, especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it.\\nHe says that he “allows himself” to talk like that – but if one dares something, one might win, but one also can perish.\\nThat seems to catch on these days.\\nFor example, the Italian moral theologian, Maurizio Chiodi, recently claimed in his talk at the Gregorian Pontifical University that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden, but even demanded!\\nTo contradict two popes – whom the Church has already “beatified” the one and “canonized” the other – so shortly after their deaths, and in such a radical and open manner, probably has never happened before in the Church's history.\\nIsaiah says that such people draw unto them God's punishment, with thick cords!\\nNevertheless, one should wish for Cardinal Marx, Bishop Bode, and Professor Chiodi that they sleep well.\\nWhether their conscience will allow it, is not so certain; but if it does not [allow it], it would certainly be a hope for their conversion.\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ\\n\\nArchbishop Viganò has released a new, powerful statement necessitated by the peculiar reaction of Pope Francis to the Aug 22 Testimony.\\nMany thanks to our friends at LifeSiteNews, especially Diane Montagna, for the following translation and release of the follow-up testimony from arguably the most courageous prelate in the Church today—Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò.\\nThe former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States has, as they say, doubled down.\\nFar from backing-away and making excuses for his early actions, as we’ve all become so accustomed to seeing in these rare cases where a hierarch breaks ranks, Archbishop Viganò is digging in with a 4-page bombshell that restates his initial accusations of abuse cover-up against Francis and other powerful members of the hierarchy, and even concludes with a suggestion that Francis is beginning to act as a “substitute of our Lord.”\\nRead the Archbishop’s words for yourselves and note well the ring of truth that resonates in every sentence.\\nThis is clearly the testimony of an honest man who has only the good of the Church in his heart—a modern-day Athanasius standing against something so much worse than Liberius.\\nFriends, let us pray for Archbishop Viganò.\\nHe is standing alone now, and not only against the most dangerous pontificate in history, but also the forces of hell itself—forces which will do all in their power to silence this voice crying in the wilderness.\\nMake no mistake about this: Archbishop Viganò is fighting for the very survival of the human element of the Catholic Church.\\nHe is standing against corrupt men in high places who cannot be trusted to do what is best for souls, for the Catholic faithful or indeed for Holy Mother Church herself.\\nThe enemy is not only at the gates but has now made their way to the thrones of power and the seats of the Apostles.\\nGod help us.\\nIt goes without saying that we here at The Remnant not only stand with Viganò but we thank God for him every day, we pray the Rosary for him every day, and wish him every blessing and heavenly consolation as he undergoes this passion for the sake of the Master he serves so well.\\nGod bless you, Your Excellency, and Mary keep you.\\nWe are with you!\\nMJM\\n_________________________________\\nTit.\\nArchbishop of Ulpiana\\nApostolic Nuncio\\nScio Cui credidi\\n(2 Tim 1:12)\\nBefore starting my writing, I would first of all like to give thanks and glory to God the Father for every situation and trial that He has prepared and will prepare for me during my life.\\nAs a priest and bishop of the holy Church, spouse of Christ, I am called like every baptized person to bear witness to the truth.\\nBy the gift of the Spirit who sustains me with joy on the path that I am called to travel, I intend to do so until the end of my days.\\nOur only Lord has addressed also to me the invitation, “Follow me!”, and I intend to follow him with the help of his grace until the end of my days.\\n“As long as I have life, I will sing to the Lord,\\nI will sing praise to my God while I have being.\\nMay my song be pleasing to him;\\nFor I rejoice in the Lord.”\\n(Psalm 103:33-34)\\n*****\\nIt has been a month since I offered my testimony, solely for the good of the Church, regarding what occurred at the audience with Pope Francis on June 23, 2013 and regarding certain matters I was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the Secretariat of State and in Washington, in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital.\\nMy decision to reveal those grave facts was for me the most painful and serious decision that I have ever made in my life.\\nI made it after long reflection and prayer, during months of profound suffering and anguish, during a crescendo of continual news of terrible events, with thousands of innocent victims destroyed and the vocations and lives of young priests and religious disturbed.\\nThe silence of the pastors who could have provided a remedy and prevented new victims became increasingly indefensible, a devastating crime for the Church.\\nWell aware of the enormous consequences that my testimony could have, because what I was about to reveal involved the successor of Peter himself, I nonetheless chose to speak in order to protect the Church, and I declare with a clear conscience before God that my testimony is true.\\nChrist died for the Church, and Peter, Servus servorum Dei, is the first one called to serve the spouse of Christ.\\nCertainly, some of the facts that I was to reveal were covered by the pontifical secret that I had promised to observe and that I had faithfully observed from the beginning of my service to the Holy See.\\nBut the purpose of any secret, including the pontifical secret, is to protect the Church from her enemies, not to cover up and become complicit in crimes committed by some of her members.\\nI was a witness, not by my choice, of shocking facts and, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church states (par.\\n2491), the seal of secrecy is not binding when very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth.\\nOnly the seal of confession could have justified my silence.\\nNeither the pope, nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted in my testimony.\\n“Qui tacet consentit” surely applies here, for if they deny my testimony, they have only to say so, and provide documentation to support that denial.\\nHow can one avoid concluding that the reason they do not provide the documentation is that they know it confirms my testimony?\\nThe center of my testimony was that since at least June 23, 2013, the pope knew from me how perverse and evil McCarrick was in his intentions and actions, and instead of taking the measures that every good pastor would have taken, the pope made McCarrick one of his principal agents in governing the Church, in regard to the United States, the Curia, and even China, as we are seeing these days with great concern and anxiety for that martyr Church.\\nNow, the pope’s reply to my testimony was: “I will not say a word!” But then, contradicting himself, he has compared his silence to that of Jesus in Nazareth and before Pilate, and compared me to the great accuser, Satan, who sows scandal and division in the Church — though without ever uttering my name.\\nIf he had said: “Viganò lied,” he would have challenged my credibility while trying to affirm his own.\\nIn so doing he would have intensified the demand of the people of God and the world for the documentation needed to determine who has told the truth.\\nInstead, he put in place a subtle slander against me — slander being an offense he has often compared to the gravity of murder.\\nIndeed, he did it repeatedly, in the context of the celebration of the most Holy Sacrament, the Eucharist, where he runs no risk of being challenged by journalists.\\nWhen he did speak to journalists, he asked them to exercise their professional maturity and draw their own conclusions.\\nBut how can journalists discover and know the truth if those directly involved with a matter refuse to answer any questions or to release any documents?\\nThe pope’s unwillingness to respond to my charges and his deafness to the appeals by the faithful for accountability are hardly consistent with his calls for transparency and bridge building.\\nMoreover, the pope’s cover-up of McCarrick was clearly not an isolated mistake.\\nMany more instances have recently been documented in the press, showing that Pope Francis has defended homosexual clergy who committed serious sexual abuses against minors or adults.\\nThese include his role in the case of Fr.\\nJulio Grassi in Buenos Aires, his reinstatement of Fr.\\nMauro Inzoli after Pope Benedict had removed him from ministry (until he went to prison, at which point Pope Francis laicized him), and his halting of the investigation of sex abuse allegations against Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor.\\nIn the meantime, a delegation of the USCCB, headed by its president Cardinal DiNardo, went to Rome asking for a Vatican investigation into McCarrick.\\nCardinal DiNardo and the other prelates should tell the Church in America and in the world: did the pope refuse to carry out a Vatican investigation into McCarrick’s crimes and of those responsible for covering them up?\\nThe faithful deserve to know.\\nI would like to make a special appeal to Cardinal Ouellet, because as nuncio I always worked in great harmony with him, and I have always had great esteem and affection towards him.\\nHe will remember when, at the end of my mission in Washington, he received me at his apartment in Rome in the evening for a long conversation.\\nAt the beginning of Pope Francis’ pontificate, he had maintained his dignity, as he had shown with courage when he was Archbishop of Québec.\\nLater, however, when his work as prefect of the Congregation for Bishops was being undermined because recommendations for episcopal appointments were being passed directly to Pope Francis by two homosexual “friends” of his dicastery, bypassing the Cardinal, he gave up.\\nHis long article in L’Osservatore Romano, in which he came out in favor of the more controversial aspects of Amoris Laetitia, represents his surrender.\\nYour Eminence, before I left for Washington, you were the one who told me of Pope Benedict’s sanctions on McCarrick.\\nYou have at your complete disposal key documents incriminating McCarrick and many in the curia for their cover-ups.\\nYour Eminence, I urge you to bear witness to the truth.\\n*****\\nFinally, I wish to encourage you, dear faithful, my brothers and sisters in Christ: never be despondent!\\nMake your own the act of faith and complete confidence in Christ Jesus, our Savior, of Saint Paul in his second Letter to Timothy, Scio cui credidi, which I choose as my episcopal motto.\\nThis is a time of repentance, of conversion, of prayers, of grace, to prepare the Church, the bride of the Lamb, ready to fight and win with Mary the battle against the old dragon.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': \"Wait!\\nWait!\\nIt’s all a MISTRANSLATION!\\n\\nThus, it took more than a year-and-a-half for the Factory to roll out the old reliable “mistranslation” defense to explain away the infamous paragraph 303 of Amoris Laetita (AL), which reads as follows in the official English translation on the Vatican website:\\nYet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel.\\nIt can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal.\\nIn other words, the conscience can “inform” a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking “for now,” given one’s particular “limits.” This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium.\\n\\nBut it’s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr.\\nDawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary.\\nAll of the critics of AL are wrong—every one of them!—because, you see, the original Latin text does not say what the English text does.\\nDr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr.\\nDawn Goldstein\\nHere we go again.\\nSo what does the Latin say?\\nHere is the paragraph in the official Latin:\\nHaec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar.\\nYes, and so what?\\nWell, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: “what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,” the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering.\\nSo, What the Pope Really Means® is: “what for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.” So, it’s an offering to God, not a response to God.\\nBig difference.\\n\\nBut just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an “offering” to God?\\nIt would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one’s “limits” make obedience to the moral law difficult.\\nAnd that is exactly the nonsense Fastiggi and Goldstein expect us to swallow: “Pope Francis is not talking about an offering of an objectively sinful action but a gift of self that moves toward God and the objective moral norm.”\\n\\nSo, our intrepid presenters of What the Pope Really Means® would have us believe that objectively immoral behavior, which is the best one can do according “the “concrete complexity of one’s limits,” is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self because it moves toward morally licit behavior.\\nFastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away.\\n\\nWhat about the English locution “while yet not fully the objective ideal,” which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals?\\nNot so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend.\\nDo not all those ignorant critics of AL know that the Latin text employs the phrase “obiectivum exemplar,” which, translated literally into English is “objective exemplar.” They declare triumphantly: “The Latin term exemplar does not mean an unattainable ideal, it specifically means a pattern or model to follow.”\\n\\nGive.\\nMe.\\nA.\\nBreak.\\nA pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: “(1) copy\/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal.\\nLikewise, the definition of the English word “exemplar” is simply: “an ideal model.”\\n\\nHere too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away.\\nFor if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely “exemplary” rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men—including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery—then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue.\\nThus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least “for now” (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an “ex” who has “remarried” and is now mired in the “concrete complexity one’s limits.”\\n\\nSo, as Fastiggi and Goldstein would have it, all the tumult triggered by AL is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who haven’t consulted the Latin text—including those ignorant Vatican translators.\\nAccording to their proposed “alternate translation” into English, What the Pope Really Means® is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one’s “limits” is “the offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.” Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words.\\n\\nIt seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness.\\nIndeed, their “proposed alternate translation” reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in “second marriages” to the “perfect objective model.” Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery?\\nAre you perfect?\\nThen again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law.\\nBut such embarrassing truths need not impede the Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line.\\nAnd Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along, changing red signals to green.\\nNo problem here!\\nhas been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto-demolition.\\n\\nBut wait, there’s more!\\nOur dynamic translators even provide their own dynamic interpretation of AL to mean that the “offering” to God of which Francis speaks is merely the decision by a divorced and “remarried” couple with children not to end their relationship, which would be the “perfect objective model,” but rather to “live in continence until they may—after the hoped for declaration of nullity—enter into a true marriage.” That is, they would have Francis affirming John Paul II’s Familiaris consortio, which repeats the Church’s constant teaching that continence is required of those who have entered into adulterous “second marriage,” failing which they cannot be admitted to the sacraments.\\n\\nBut the Fastiggi-Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore: i.e., that people in “second marriages” do not have to live in continence, but rather—in “certain cases”—may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a “process of discernment.” As we know, in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires, published on the Vatican website (in response to a query he himself may have solicited), Bergoglio informed them “there is no other interpretation.”\\n\\nMoreover, the Maltese bishops' “guidelines” for implementing AL, published in L’Osservatore Romano—for which Bergoglio thanked them—declare thus:\\nIf, as a result of the process of discernment, undertaken with “humility, discretion and love for the Church and her teaching, in a sincere search for God’s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it” (AL 300), a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages, with an informed and enlightened conscience, to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God, he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (see AL, notes 336 and 351).\\nThis Pope’s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub-magisterial winks and nods, both oral and written, is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis.\\nSee the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.\\n\\nShaw maintains that AL can be “bent into some kind of orthodoxy.” Perhaps.\\nBut it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope’s statements into conformity with the Faith.\\nMoreover, any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers—while others disagree—has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church, which he alone has the duty to correct.\\nBut Francis, as any reasonable observer can see, has no intention of offering any such correction.\\nQuite to the contrary, confusion as a cover for the introduction of Holy Communion for “certain” public adulterers by Bergoglio’s co-conspirators in the Vatican and various dioceses is exactly what he was aiming to achieve from the beginning of the whole synodal charade, which was merely a vehicle for promulgation of AL.\\nAs Shaw observes of AL: “What we [the signers of the Correctio] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there.”\\n\\nIn a sense, what Bergoglio is doing is worse than explicit heresy, which could at least be readily identified and denounced as such.\\nBut Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy—undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion, whose integrity is affirmed verbally—without the guilt of an explicit promulgation.\\nIn so acting, he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council (the Third Council of Constantinople) and by his own successor (Leo II) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy (no human but only a divine will in Christ).\\nHonorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy, endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine.\\nAnd yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy.\\nA similar judgment might well befall this Pope, but it is not for us to level it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL, Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy.\\nIn a classic power move, he has just given a sop to Cardinal Burke, the perceived leader of the opposition, by appointing him to a minor position on the Apostolic Signatura—the same tribunal from which Bergoglio brutally removed him as Prefect.\\nAnd this after also humiliating Burke as the spiritual patron of the Knights of Malta, to which he was exiled after his removal.\\n\\nWill this sop buy Burke’s silence, staving off the feared public correction?\\nWe will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily.\\nBut this move demonstrates—if more evidence were needed—that Bergoglio has never been the humble apostle of mercy depicted in his carefully crafted public relations narrative, but rather a cunning ecclesiastical politician, constantly plotting and scheming to get what he wants.\\nThat the neo-Catholic establishment refuses to recognize the grim reality of this unprecedented pontificate is but another page in the long annals of its shameful defense of the indefensible to the detriment of Holy Mother Church.\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders\\n\\nThe Francis Vatican’s approach to the contemplative life is probably the most illustrative of our entire crisis.\\nContemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end.\\nIt has no “use” in the sense that either the Bergoglians – in terms of their political machinations – or the world can understand.\\nThere is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian\/Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted.\\nOne aspect of Pope Francis’ character that seems little-explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life – a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church’s undertakings.\\nThe world does not understand it or want it.\\nTherefore, it is something of a thorn in the Bergoglian side, and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it.\\nSo when, in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns, the faithful braced for impact .\\nIn his recent document, ostensibly on holiness, “Gaudete et Exultate,” the pope attacked the religious desire for silence and solitude, to be alone with God in prayer, seeking unity with Him, saying in essence that the Christian life is inherently about social activism, about material, worldly ends.\\nTo these foundations of the contemplative life – indeed of any form of religious life in the Church – Francis set up another of his false dichotomies, contemplation in opposition to serving others, giving a Jesuit maxim as an imperative for all Catholics: “We are called to be contemplatives even in the midst of action, and to grow in holiness by responsibly and generously carrying out our proper mission.”\\nItalian Vaticanist Marco Tosatti commented dryly, “Rejoice and be glad… but not if you’re a cloistered contemplative.”\\nIn 2016, I wrote that Francis’ Apostolic Constitution, “Vultum dei quaerere” was in some respects the most damaging object of the wrecking-ball pontificate to date.\\nUnfortunately, it was about a subject that the world, and therefore the modern Church, cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed.\\nAimed specifically at female contemplative religious, the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations.\\nThe new document issued last week, “Cor orans,” is juridical, that is, it is not much more than a list of specific norms, or rules – 289 of them!\\n– that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow.\\nOne odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives:\\n“A monastery of nuns, as every religious house, is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the Church and for the Institute.” (emphasis added)\\nWait… its “usefulness”?\\nI think a fair question for the Faithful to ask this Vatican department might be, “According to what specific criteria is a monastery’s ‘usefulness’ actually determined?”\\nOne can’t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century Europe.\\nA house that could prove to the secularists that it was “useful” – that it could care for the indigent elderly, teach children or nurse the sick – would be allowed to continue.\\nThose which were purely contemplative – a single-minded devotion to the adoration of God – were closed.\\nIt is not an insignificant quirk of modern history, and one that tells us much about the nature of the current pontificate, that houses of contemplatives are always attacked by secularist regimes, from Henry VIII to the Soviet Union.\\nRupture?\\nWhat rupture?\\nThe first thing Cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and post-Vatican II theology.\\nIn the Introduction, it seems anxious to establish a “hermeneutic of continuity” with Pius XII and his document Sponsa Christi Ecclesia of 1950.\\nThe authors insist there is no contradiction between the two – except, of course, where there are contradictions – and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the “aim of their specific vocation.” It describes Francis as promulgating this document “in the wake” of Pius XII[1].\\nIn fact, Pope Francis, by promulgating the Apostolic Constitution Vultum Dei quaerere, on June 29, 2016, to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation, invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular, but he did not intend to abrogate Sponsa Christi Ecclesia that was derogated only in some points.\\nAs a consequence, the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision.\\nBut of course, the entire game is given away in the next paragraph:\\nPope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.\\nYes, that’s what it said.\\nHere’s my translation:\\n“The Church’s ‘path’ of the last 50 years has been ‘fruitful’.\\nHow do you know?\\nBecause we’re telling you it has.”\\nIn other words, there have been absolutely no problems whatever with the direction taken either by the Church or by the religious life since Vatican II.\\nEverything that has happened has been in complete and perfect continuity between the Before Church and the After Church; there has been no rupture or break with the past.\\nAll changes undertaken by religious houses were perfectly legitimate and good - “fruitful” if, perhaps, a bit “intense” – and have been made in “light of the teachings” of Vatican II and “changed socio-cultural conditions.” There is, therefore, no legitimate reason whatever for any religious house to attempt to “turn back the clock” to the pre-Vatican II norms or styles of religious life.\\nAnyone attempting to do this are Bad Nuns [insert string of incomprehensible papal insults here.]\\nThis is what might be considered the guiding principle of the document; “Nothing to see here.\\nAnd if you say there is, you’re the problem.”\\nOf course, this kind of bold proclamation is very much in keeping with the habit of this pontificate to simply claim there are no problems and become gravely offended and outraged when the contrary is pointed out.\\nIt’s your fault if you find contradictions, not theirs; they’ve said there are no contradictions, therefore there aren’t any.\\nAfter all, this is the papacy where 2 + 2 = 5 if the pope says it does.\\nThe irony, of course, is built in, since this document is intended as a legal chopping block for the dissolution of any house of contemplative nuns that is judged to be hovering on the edge of extinction or is for some other reason in need of the chop.\\nWhy would the Vatican need a document giving extensive norms for the closure of monasteries that have too few nuns or do not follow their originally intended charisms if everything about the religious life since Vatican II has been hunky dory?\\nLet’s remember that this comes from the Congregation for Religious of Braz de’Aviz and Jose Rodriguez Carballo.\\nThis is the Cardinal Braz de’Aviz[2] who wasted no time in orienting himself in the New Paradigm when, close on the heels of the Conclave he slammed the attempt by his predecessor – and by extension Pope Benedict – to reign in the notorious Leadership Conference of Women Religious in the US.\\nHe complained that he had been shut out of the process under Cardinal Rode, and later made a large and public point of appeasing and mollifying the most outspokenly heretical and politicised organisation of female religious in the world.\\nApparently the total statistical collapse of the religious life following Vatican II[3] had nothing to do with the massive systemic changes to the forms of that life – always claimed to be “mandated” by “the Council”.\\nAnd of course we are talking about the priorities of a pope who has said that seeing a “restorationist” community enjoying a large number of vocations makes him “worry.” Apparently this worry was serious enough to move him to torpedo one of the most flourishing communities in the modern Church; the gaunt spectre of the Franciscan Friars and Sisters of the Immaculate haunts this document.\\nAutonomy vs.\\nIndependence\\nOne of the talking points the media have latched onto is the whole business of “autonomy” of monasteries.\\nMany of the headlines crowed: “Vatican confirms nuns’ autonomy,” or similar.\\nBut that word does not mean what they think it means.\\nIn fact, the word “autonomy” is the key to understanding this whole thing.\\nIt appears in the document 16 times and “autonomous” 30 times.\\nIn fact, “autonomy” is held up as the single most important criterion for determining a monastery’s viability.\\nThis emphasis is repeated so often one might almost think there is a concern in Rome that the “fruitful” post-conciliar monastic life is in danger of fizzling out… for… some reason…\\nMonastery sui juris refers to the religious house of a female monastic community that, having the requisites for real autonomy of life, was legitimately erected by the Holy See and enjoys juridical autonomy under the law.\\n18 In order to obtain juridical autonomy for a monastery of nuns, it must presuppose a real autonomy of life, that is, the ability to manage the life of the monastery in all its dimensions (vocational, formative, governmental, relational, liturgical, economic ...).\\nIn this case, an autonomous monastery is alive and vital.\\n43 Autonomy of life, a constant prerequisite for maintaining juridical autonomy, must be constantly verified by the Federal President who, when in her judgment a monastery lacks autonomy of life, must inform the Holy See in view of the nomination of an ad hoc commission.\\n67 Affiliation [with another monastery, appointed by the Vatican] can be an opportunity for recovery and rebirth when autonomy of life is partially compromised.\\nIf the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.\\nno longer possesses a real autonomy of life , it is the responsibility of the Federation President to report the matter to the Holy See.\\nWhen an autonomous monastery , it is the responsibility ofto the Holy See.\\nAt the same time, this document is redefining the term “autonomous” to exclude independence.\\nWhat got no mention in the brief press interest was the document’s insistence that all monasteries of nuns must belong to a federation and while monasteries must demonstrate “autonomy” they will be granted little in the way of powers of self-governance.\\nAs we will see, the federations are now a multilayered system of internal surveillance and centralised control that leaves Orwell in the dust:\\novercome isolation and promote regular observance and contemplative life.\\nFederation of monasteries means a structure of communion among some autonomous monasteries of the same Institute [4] , erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, so that in sharing the same charism, the federated monasteriesand promote regular observance and contemplative life.\\nNote the change: “independent” is replaced with “isolated[5].” It reminds me of a conversation I had with a superior of a Benedictine house in the UK.\\nShe said she thought that the psychiatric testing, that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery’s federation, was excessive and not helpful.\\nShe didn’t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate’s suitability for religious life, so she didn’t require these tests of her monastery’s postulants.\\nShe also said that she was under constant pressure, both the subtle pressure of general peer disapproval and overt requests to conform by the federation’s leadership.\\nWas that monastery “isolated”?\\nOr just exercising lawful self-governance?\\nAnd given that autonomy is being held up as the sole criterion for viability of a monastery, it seems the Holy See is not interested in asking whether it is actually faithful to the charism, or even to the Catholic Faith, a question that has burned brightly for serious Catholics for some time.\\nThe word “fidelity” appears in the document four times, which may give an idea of how much interest the Vatican has in this issue.\\nFunny you should mention autonomy: Bioethics and the dissolution of “unviable” monasteries\\nIt’s funny that the buzzword of the day in Rome should be “autonomy”.\\nAs we shall see, the document is what I’ve called above a “chopping block”.\\nVultum dei quaerere made it clear that this juridical document would provide a set of legal criteria by which a monastery can be considered viable, religious life worthy of life, so to speak, and that those considered to have failed the test would be closed.\\nNote the language used here:\\nIf the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.\\nIt jogged a memory for me.\\n“Incapacity”… Where had I heard that language used before?\\nMost pro-life observers in Britain will tell you that it was the “Mental Capacity Act” of 2005 that established in British law the concept that a person with permanently “reduced capacity” could be legally starved and\/or dehydrated to death by doctors.\\nThis is the world, the language, of Bioethics, applied utilitarianism, also called “Principlism” after its three bioethical criteria of “justice, beneficence[6] and autonomy” – it is a patient’s ability to demonstrate his “autonomy” or “quality of life,[7]” either currently or potentially, that decides his fate.\\nThis set of criteria is being applied in medical institutions across the western world now, a “new paradigm” of ethics replacing traditional “Hippocratic” or “Natural Law” medical ethics.\\nUnder this system the onus, effectively, is on the patient to prove according to the new criteria that he is worthy of receiving medical treatment – of continuing to live.\\nMedical treatment (which legally includes food and water) can be withdrawn from patients who fail to demonstrate that they will recover sufficiently to return to an autonomous lifestyle.\\nHealth care systems like that of the UK have government regulatory boards giving out “guidelines” to determine in a uniform way how health care resources are allocated.\\nThese guidelines are collated by professional Bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria.\\nIf the equation doesn’t come out in the patient’s favour, the “treatment” recommended for the patient’s “best interests” will include his demise, often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration and\/or administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives.\\nThe NHS in the UK has actually gone to court, and won, declaring that they must retain the right to kill patients who fail the Bioethics test.\\nThe result has been a quiet reign of terror in which elderly and disabled people have started carrying cards stating in legalese that they do not want to be killed by their doctors.\\nIn one case a man with ALS took the NHS to court in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preemptively preclude his medical murder when his illness left him incapacitated.\\nThe system, in other words, is stacked against the patient, in favour of the government that holds all the cards.\\nKeep these facts in mind as we read through the rest of the document.\\nI think we can find an almost perfect analogy by replacing the term “patient” with “monastery.” Think about how one would apply concepts like “autonomy,” “viability,” “incapacity,” “quality of life” and “equitable distribution of scarce resources” to this context.\\nWhen the language of utilitarianism appears in Vatican documents as guiding criteria for the contemplative religious life, one has to wonder at what point has the entire project gone so disastrously off the rails.\\nFederations as Vatican watchdogs\\nUnder this law, all monasteries of contemplative nuns must belong to a federation.\\nPreviously only voluntary and consultative, federations will now have the power to supervise and guide the formation of candidates, nuns and of their formators, as well as possess broad powers over temporal goods of individual monasteries and powers of suppression.\\nThe document makes it inarguable that the federation’s main role will be to establish and monitor for conformity to a particular programme – the “intense and fruitful path” of the Church since 1965 – both within the various orders and between them:\\nThe Federal Assembly:\\ndeals with issues of major importance; makes decisions and issues norms that all nuns are required to observe, after the definitive approval of the Holy See;\\nMore than just federations; a multi-tier system of control\\nConference of monasteries means a structure of communion among autonomous monasteries, belonging to diverse Institutes and present in the same region... in particular geographical or linguistic contexts.\\nIn other words, Benedictine federations of a given area will form a “Conference” with Carmelite federations and Dominican federations and Poor Clare federations, etc.\\nThis will be of interest to Carmelite houses especially, since they tend to be generally more on the “conservative” end of things.\\nImagine a house of traditional Carmelites attending regional Conference meetings – and attempting to keep up their Office schedule – with the balloons-and-guitars, break dancing Franciscans…What fun!\\nAnd finally, just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock, there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas; there will be watchers watching the watchers:\\nConfederation means a structure of connection among Federations of monasteries, erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism, to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual Federations.\\nBroad powers\\nFederations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and, crucially, over formation of nuns.\\nIt is the Federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules, to report non-compliance to the Holy See, to make new foundations and, apparently, to “encourage” individual monasteries to “communicate” their goods.\\nThe legitimately established Federation is a public juridic person in the Church and is therefore able to acquire, possess, administer, and alienate temporal, movable and immovable goods, which are ecclesiastical assets, in accordance with the universal and proper law.\\nTo keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries, implementing one of the aims of the Federation, a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries, coordinated by the Federal President.\\nThe communication of goods in a Federation is implemented through contributions, gifts, loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties, and for the common needs of the Federation.\\nThe Federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals.\\nFinancial incentives\\nGiven that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like “vitality in living and transmitting the charism” and “dynamic fidelity” to the order’s charism, and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation, one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct[8].\\nSince the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery, this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind.\\nArticle 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek “legal recognition also in the civil sphere.” This, presumably, will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries.\\nArticle 73, on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct:\\nIn the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery, when there are no surviving nuns, unless otherwise provided by the Holy See, the destination of the suppressed monastery's assets, in compliance with canon and civil law, go to the respective higher juridical person, that is, to the Federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic Congregation.\\nThe economic fund [of the federation] is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries, by the donations of benefactors, and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries, as established by the present Instruction.\\nFederations in charge of formation\\nThe Federation President, in particular, watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the Institute, so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time.\\nAt the end of the visit, she will inform the Holy See about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation.\\nThe formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the Federation, therefore, the President of the Federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation; if this does not happen, she will refer the matter to the Holy See.\\nThe President of the Federation, having heard the opinion of the Federal Council, chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators, as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority, establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community.\\nWho makes new foundations and why?\\nThroughout the history of the Church, it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses.\\nNow, with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right, according to this document, the federations themselves can make foundations.\\nthrough the action of the Federation, as established by the Federal Assembly The foundation of a monastery of nuns, keeping in mind what is established in no.\\n39 of the present Instruction, can take place either by a single monastery or, as established by the Federal Assembly [9]\\nA single monastic community that decides to make a foundation, moreover, must be “helped” and guided by the federation:\\nIn discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious Assistant intervene to help the Superior of the founding monastery.\\nThe discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.\\nArticle 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that “must be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective.”\\nthe necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism,” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”.\\na) A community that has given good testimony of fraternal life in common with “” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”.\\nb) Besides the number, special skills are required of some nuns of the community who must be able to assume: as Superior, the service of authority; as formator, the initial formation of candidates; as financial administrator, the administration of the goods of the monastery.\\nc) Rooms adapted to the lifestyle of the community, to ensure that the nuns can regularly lead the contemplative life according to the nature and spirit of their Institute.\\nd) Economic conditions that guarantee the community itself can provide for the needs of daily life.\\nOne of these things is not like the others.\\nDid you notice?\\nOne criterion stands out as indeterminate, vague, compared with the other concrete and measurable standards.\\nOne aspect of legislative analysis that I learned early was that the terms used are of utmost importance.\\nIf a term is vague or is defined incorrectly that is a “loophole”.\\nOr it could perhaps be described as a handle; a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe.\\nSo, how, exactly, is it to be determined – and by whom – that a group of nuns possess “the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism”?\\nWhat, precisely, does the term “vitality” mean and exactly how is one to measure out how much is required?\\nIs this one of Pope Francis little personal, secret expressions of which only he knows the meaning?\\nLike the secret to how nuns are to smile properly?\\nDoes the inclusion of completely subjective criteria belong in a juridical document?\\nOr is it in there in order to provide cover for prelates?\\nThe next article tells us, “It is the responsibility of the Holy See to evaluate the presence of these requisites.” Do they have an electronic meter in a cupboard in the Congregation for Religious that measures “charism vitality”?\\nIt seems important to ask because article 70, on how to suppress a monastery, includes it:\\nAmong the criteria that can contribute to determine a judgment concerning the suppression of a monastery, after having examined all the circumstances, the following points should be considered as a whole: the number of nuns, the advanced age of the majority of the members, the real capacity for government and formation, lack of candidates for a number of years, lack of the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism in dynamic fidelity[10].\\nYou will be affiliated; resistance is futile…\\nIt seems there are two themes running through the document: to establish a certain value of “autonomy” as the indispensable criterion for viability, while at the same time asserting top-down oversight and control over who gets to make this determination.\\nIn short, a monastery must be autonomous, but heaven help the community that asserts its independence.\\nArticles 54-64 offer an interim measure in the case of “incapacity” that is really just more of the second thing.\\nOnce a lack of autonomy has been established…\\n54 Affiliation is a particular form of help that the Holy See establishes in particular situations in favor of the community of a monastery sui juris which has only an asserted autonomy, but in reality, very precarious or, in fact, non-existent.\\n55 Affiliation is configured as a juridical support that must assess whether the inability to manage the life of the autonomous monastery in all its dimensions is only temporary or is irreversible, helping the community of the affiliated monastery to overcome difficulties or to put in place what is necessary to bring about the suppression of this monastery.\\nHow does affiliation work?\\nWell, the federation and the Holy See between them work it out:\\nIn these cases, it is up to the Holy See to evaluate the opportunity of setting up an ad hoc commission formed by the Ordinary, the Federation President, the Federal Assistant, and the Major Superior of the monastery\\nIt’s starting to be clear that the federation is going to be little more than the Big Brother hit-squad of the Congregation for Religious.\\nIt’s worth remembering what happened in the case of a German men’s monastery in which the superior tried to return the community to pre-Vatican II practices.\\nMariawald Trappist monastery – 900 years old – was finally dissolved, affiliated to death.\\nIts superior had made the fatal error of openly declaring – in 2008, after the publication of Summorum Pontificum – that the monastery’s problems all began when it adopted the new liturgical rites and implemented the trends of all religious after Vatican II, and that clearly the solution was to go back to pre-conciliar ways.\\nMariawald was consequently affiliated, in the manner this document describes, with a liberal house in the Netherlands whose superior, unsurprisingly, discovered that the house was hopelessly divided and could not be saved.\\nWhat would make forced affiliation a truly devastating weapon against conservative or traditional communities is the proviso that an affiliated monastery may not form its own novices:\\n60 The affiliated monastery can accept candidates, but the novitiate and initial formation must be performed in the affiliating monastery or in another monastery established by the Federation.”\\nOf course, this means it is the affiliating monastery’s formation team that would make the determination to dismiss recalcitrant, “neo-pelagian” postulants and novices.\\n~\\nThis brings us to about article 155 of the document.\\nPart two to come.\\n_______________\\n[1] It would seem, therefore, that a useful task for someone writing about what this pope intends for nuns would be to read Sponsa Christi Ecclesia as well as Francis’ Apostolic Constitution and make a careful comparison.\\nI’m not going to do that here, but it might be helpful to examine the two documents with the help of a expert at some point.\\n[2] Worth remembering, however, is the fact that it was Benedict the “conservative,” not Francis, who appointed Braz de’ Aviz in the office to replace Cardinal Rode – presumably under that good old “conservative” rubric of the “big umbrella” – under whom these culpably belated attempts to save US religious life were started.\\n[3] Just considering the numbers of course.\\nLeaving alone the doctrinal issues.\\n[4] “The same Institute” means the order in question, whether Benedictine, Dominican, Carmelite etc.\\n[5] I’d love to hear from some monastic superior who had the nerve to tell Rome, “Actually, given that all our neighbours in religion are raging neo-modernist heretics, if not schismatics, we think ‘isolation’ is a desirable thing – like quarantine during an outbreak of Bubonic Plague – and would therefore like to be dispensed from the federation requirement.” I’d pay good money to see the shade of purple the well-fed Braz de’Aviz turned.\\n[6] “justice and beneficence” are considered on behalf of the community, not the patient\\n[7] Bioethicists take it as read that in order for a life to have sufficient “quality” it must demonstrate sufficient autonomy.\\nDependence upon the care of others is, quite literally, a capital offence.\\n[8] Readers may think I’m exaggerating the danger of material motivations for suppressing monasteries, but as we will see, the distinction between the federations and the Holy See is also a matter of paperwork and it is well to recall that the secretary for the Congregation for Religious, Jose Rodrigues Carballo, was a person of interest to international police agencies for the loss of “tens of millions” of Euros from the coffers of the Franciscan Friars Minor, the original Franciscan order of which he had been the head.\\nShortly after Carballo’s appointment, it was revealed that the Swiss prosecutor’s office was investigating the money missing from the Friars Minor in connection with drugs, money laundering operations and gun running.\\nCarballo was Francis’ very first appointment, April 6, 2013, three weeks after the Conclave and it was to him that the pope gave the task of the destruction of the FFIs, and a major part of that operation was to separate the FFIs from real assets valued at about 30 million Euros.\\n[9] So much for the principle of subsidiarity.\\nI can imagine what a monastery founded by a committee would be like to live in.\\n[10] We’ll pass over “dynamic fidelity” in silence for now…\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': 'A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?\\n\\nThe meeting covered Carmels of the Teresian, Discalced, reform from Germany, five areas of Spain, three from France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Croatia and the Holy Land [1] .\\nThe reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in Cor orans were already in place: federations with broad powers, including financial control and combined formation courses, “religious assistant” priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations.\\nGiven that this was 2009, it is clear that the plans to force all contemplative monasteries in the world into this disastrous European mould were well under way long before Pope Benedict was even considering resigning.\\nToday I’ve received an interesting document issued by the Carmelite Order in Europe following a meeting of the “Federations of Discalced Carmelite Nuns of Europe & the Holy Land” in Avila, February 2009.\\nAs a snapshot of the current condition of Carmelite monastic life after it had been completely “federated,” it paints a depressing picture; but as a demonstration of what “federations” are likely to achieve once Cor orans is implemented universally, it clangs in the mind like a funeral bell.\\nReconciled to managed extinction\\nThe report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80, “infirmary Carmels,” nuns in state nursing homes, entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation.\\nSolutions offered are equally uniform: heaped-up bureaucracy, common formation courses between monasteries developed by “religious psychologists,” ever more powers handed to federations.\\nThis is federated Carmelite monastic life under Pope Francis’ New Paradigm of fully implemented VaticanTwoism.\\nVery little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts.\\nAnd perhaps most telling of all, not one word is offered of applying any systematic religious solutions; no one is suggesting increased prayer or fasting, Rosary campaigns or novenas in what has to be the Carmelite Order’s most desperate hour.\\nNothing is said of increased intensity of devotion to the charism, study of the foundress or returning to sources, still less of strengthening the Carmelites’ traditional independent self-governance or reconsidering the wisdom of “the path taken”.\\nIndeed, in one case in Spain, the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether.\\nThe report from Great Britain notes: “18 Carmels have closed in the last 40 years.\\nThere have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process.\\nTwo communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure.”\\nThe case of the Netherlands is downright bizarre; sisters so old that even the federation structures are breaking down.\\nOnly one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands, and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers.\\nBut in this situation, the “solution” undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle, including gaining approval from Rome, for “a completely new structure,” whose main task, no doubt, will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books.\\nThe atmosphere is weirdly resigned – one federation report recommended simply “forgetting the numbers” – with many notes of mutual congratulation over “unity,” the creating of “links” and the “building of trust” and “dialogue” between communities.\\nThe report from Belgium – federated in 1997, average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries – states tersely that their biggest problem is “ageing” but under “possible solutions” says only, “We want to continue along the path we have begun.”\\nIt is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2].\\nIt is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention.\\nFederation of Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina: 82 nuns in 5 convents, with an average age of 47, and eleven in formation.\\nThis outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects, notably that it was only federated in 2002.\\nBut the effects of the federating\/formation courses are already being felt: “Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.”\\nPath taken: Have made a foundation in Albania; however this community is not federated.\\nFrom the beginning, our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation.\\nEach year, we have one or two seminars, which are also the occasion to the meeting of the Council of the Association.\\nThe duration is 3 to 4 days and they take place every time in a different Monastery of the Association.\\nWe invite the sisters of other Carmelite convents friends to our formation courses: sisters from Albania, Slovenia and Bulgaria.\\nPresent Problems: In general, in our Association the vocations continue growing, but there are differences between the monasteries.\\nNowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.\\nPossible solutions: We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion, collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit.\\nThese self-generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting.\\nAll speak of nothing but bureaucratic responses: shared “formation courses,” meetings of superiors, amalgamations and suppression of houses and finally “care homes” and houses given over entirely as infirmaries.\\nA tale of controlled, systematized extinction.\\n~~~\\nFederation: Germany\\ndate when erected: 1980\\nnumber of convents: 14\\nnumber of nuns: 178\\nsolemnly professed: 170\\nin

everyday life.\\nMoreover, the high number of Carmels makes difficult to maintain all presences.\\nPossible Solutions: It is completely necessary to assume the way of the restructurings, in order to live what is essential, forgetting the numbers.\\nThe challenge to grow in confidence and communion should lead us to downgrade the famous and untouchable autonomy because, to a daughter of Saint Teresa, the really important thing is to look for HIM and to live in obedience.\\nAnother of our challenges is caring [for] the ecclesial presences.\\nWe think this is the way will lead us to recreate

ready to accept sisters who cannot be cared for in their own communities.\\nHowever, this has not been accepted because they do not want to be separated.\\nThe strangest report came from the Netherlands where, for a single surviving autonomous monastery and an average age of 81, resources were mobilised to create “a completely new structure,” complete with approval from the Congregation for Religious:\\nFederation: Netherlands\\nDate when erected: 1971\\nNumber of convents: 6\\nNumber of nuns: 73\\nSolemnly professed: 73\\nIn formation: ....\\nAverage age: 81 [NB, the bold was in the original.]\\nWhat has been done: 13 Dutch Carmels and one in Iceland have united in a Federation.\\nThis has created a close communion from the beginning.\\nEveryone has collaborated in the process of amalgamations and suppressions.\\nPresent Problems: Only one Carmel functions fully autonomously in the Netherlands.\\n4 communities are in a care-home run by the Brothers of the Immaculate Conception.\\nAnother Carmel was renewed in 1990.\\nAt the original Carmel an infirmary wing has been added for those sisters who require nursing; it is run by Franciscan sisters.\\nWith the passing of time the Assembly of the Federation has transferred tasks to the President of the Federation, according to the faculties described in the statutes, in particular regarding our mutual solidarity.\\nAlso, with the passing of the years, the Congregation for Religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the Council of the Federation.\\nFinally, the autonomous Carmels have asked help from the Federation in order to protect their interests.\\nDue to our very advanced age in the Netherlands we have reached the moment when a General Assembly is no longer possible.\\nWe are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters.\\nThe structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible.\\nPossible solutions: The Federation Council, the Religious Assistant, together with a canon lawyer of the Dutch Conference of Religious, have worked hard on a completely new structure, in which in its first draft the autonomy of the Carmel has been constantly kept in mind.\\nWe began from three points:\\n1)Maintenance of the formal autonomy of the Carmels that still exist, but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the Federation.\\n\\n2)Appointment of The Federal board or Federal Council of the Federation, preferably appointed by the Superior General.\\nThe team will consist of a president and vice-president who are members of one of the convents, appointed to functions, and of three people who are members, or not, of one of the convents.\\n\\n3)A Supervisory council, also to be appointed periodically by the Superior General, which will be made up of three members, whose president will be, preferably, a member of a religious institute, preferably of the Carmelite Order and appointed to functions.\\nThis council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the Assembly of the Federation.\\nIn October 2008, the President, the Religious Assistant and a Lawyer were in Rome where they explained the proposals.\\nThey had meetings with Fr.\\nGeneral and with the Congregation for Religious.\\nThese were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters.\\nAn important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the Federal Council of the Federation and the Supervisory council.\\nWe were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter, but we think that, in view of our present situation today, we do not have much choice.\\nIt is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way, so that all the sisters, even those advanced in years, can continue to live their life in Carmel.\\nDefinitive permission came at the 25th of February.\\n~~~\\nGiven this incredible picture of a Carmelite Order in the last rattle of its death throes, the rest of the summaries of speeches given at the meeting in Avila read as outright surreal, leaving us to wonder if any of these people are attached in any way to reality.\\nSr. Enrica Rosanna, the representative of the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious told them that the “two great challenges to our contemplative life” are “the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy.” She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive, dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation.\\nCor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018:\\nThe nuns were exhorted to “stay awake to welcome the dawn” of a bright new future:\\n“These are difficult and uncertain times, but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself.” “Our aim must be to be open to the future.\\nWe should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps.\\nIt is a wide road that opens up before us.\\nWe must be women of hope and faith.\\nWe must always believe that God is the one who directs history.\\nFrom this derives our task, to be creative and, at the same time, faithful (creative fidelity).” [emphasis in the original.]\\nWhile there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the Carmelite Order in Western Europe was foremost in the minds of the nuns present, it seems that the issue was simply not addressed out loud by the representatives of the bureaucracy.\\nInstead, Sr. Enrica, after this bizarre and cryptic comment, spoke of the “problems and difficulties that we can encounter” in discernment of mostly non-existent vocations, including “consumerism, modern means of communication, difficulties in creating a stable personality, autonomy of the young, the need to be always supported, the ideology of subjectivism.”\\nWhat are these people smoking?\\nGiven that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis\/Kasper, one wonders what this “new dawn” was actually about.\\nPerhaps a useful question for one of the nuns present could have been, “A ‘new dawn’ of what, exactly?” This kind of coded language has been popular with the progressivist faction in the Church since the 1960s, when the expectation was for the installation of a totally new Church.\\nWas Sr. Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie-era dreams in the years to come?\\nIt is certainly clear from Francis’ first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities.\\nHis first appointment, no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo, the Religious Congregation’s Secretary and – given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them – the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor.\\nThe first task Francis gave Carballo was the demolition of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate.\\nCertainly this record of the European Carmelites’ meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way.\\nOn the final day of the meeting, the “theme for the day” was offered by then-Father General Luis Arostegui: “Government: the need for change.\\nAutonomy and Association; autonomy and Fr.\\nGeneral; other solutions to government.”\\nThe devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone’s mind, as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently: “Essential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community: abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community,” the Father General warned.\\nAnd there were certainly hints that a general re-organisation of structures of authority was in the works.\\nA common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to “ask questions” rather than make suggestions, and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address:\\n“Who discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy; is it the community or chosen people?\\n“Are there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations?\\n“At the time of St. Teresa she was an example of someone balanced.\\nStability is one reason [for autonomy], but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the Order and to the Church?\\n“The valiant and prophetic initiative of Pope Pius XII to create Associations and Federations opened up contemplative life, though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy.\\nCan such essential autonomy continue as it is?\\n“50 years ago there was stability.\\nHow do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and Federation-Association and between autonomy and Fr.\\nGeneral?\\n“Could there be other forms of government?”\\nFollowing the Father General’s address are notes from the language groups, including the following:\\n“While some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched, and have certain fears of ‘external’ interference, others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that, without going to the Congregation would have a juridical form, where the President with her Council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain, our hands tied.\\nThough we want these legal channels to be established, it must remain clear what the limits of the Federation Council are, in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same.” “...The absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when… the same person remains prioress for years.” “...We need criteria that expand number 203 of our Constitutions and clarify vital autonomy.\\nWe perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures.\\nWe do not want new figures but rather those that already exist (Associations, [federation] Presidents, Provincials...) be empowered in a legal way (canonically) to help communities in difficulty, for the mission to discern, to counsel, to accompany.” “...We are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to Federations, we see that we should be close to them.”\\nMaybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from Rome in 2018, now that the “progressivist” faction in the Vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction.\\nWhat comes clear comparing this document to Cor orans is that the Vatican’s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic, heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it.\\nAnd with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads.\\nSo many Catholics in the last 40 years assumed that under the “conservatives” John Paul II and Benedict XVI at least the Vatican was “onside.” At least in Rome they understood the terrible threat of the Bolshie VaticanTwoist revolutionaries.\\nBut this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a Roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion.\\n_____________________\\n[1] An aside that will perhaps be noteworthy to traditionalist readers is the little comment in the report on the difficulty of having a liturgical observance between all the disparate nations represented at the meeting.\\n“Eucharist and Lauds in Spanish.\\nFr.\\nIsidore D’Silva had prepared a booklet with the liturgy for each day.\\nEach psalm was in a different language, and was prepared by the corresponding liturgical group.\\nHowever, having the text in front of us made it easier to follow the recitation in other languages.\\nThe end result was that we could all join in the liturgy.\\nWe were all united in the praise of the Spirit who had brought us there together from different languages and nations.”\\n[2] Solution: new foundations, the spreading of the Carmelite charism into new territories.\\n[3] This includes all sisters up to final profession, not just postulants and novices.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Agencies scramble to prep Russia probe files for release after sweeping Trump order\\n\\nIntelligence agencies were scrambling Tuesday to comply with a sweeping order by President Trump to declassify key documents that could shed light on the origins of the Russia collusion probe that has hamstrung the administration for more than 18 months.\\n\\nThe documents Trump ordered declassified involve a renewed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page and text messages from disgraced former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\\n\\n\\nThe president on Monday afternoon ordered that the documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,” according to a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.\\n\\nIt is not immediately clear how and when the documents will be released, but by Monday evening, intelligence agencies said they had already begun working to prepare the documents.\\n\\n“When the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America’s national security interests,” a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News.\\n“The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”\\n\\nODNI spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was “working expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.”\\n\\nThe documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant.\\nThe 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format.\\nThe June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.\\n\\nThe president also ordered the release of unredacted text messages from fired FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, former FBI counsel Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\\n\\nThe president for months has blasted Strzok and Page for the bias revealed in their text messages, as well as Comey and McCabe for their leadership of the FBI.\\nComey was fired from the bureau in May 2017; McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March; Page left the bureau in May; and Strzok was fired last month.\\nA source familiar with the timing of the declassification told Fox News they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.\\n\\nThe source added that the Justice Department is working on a \"compressed timeline\" and they expect the first release of records in days or sooner.\\nThe text messages are expected to take longer because of the sheer number involved and the fact that Trump ordered their release without redactions.\\n\\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., are touting the president’s order, saying it covers “pretty much everything that he wanted…and the text messages are a bonus,” a source said of Nunes.\\n\\nCongressional Republicans are hoping the files reveal details about the start of the Russia investigation led by the FBI, which evolved into Special Counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.\\n\\nBut Democrats,including the committee’s ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., are blasting the declassification order as a “clear abuse of power.”\\n\\n\"[Trump] has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative,\" Schiff said.\\n\"With respect to some of these materials, I have been previously informed by the FBI and Justice Department that they would consider their release a red line that must not be crossed as they may compromise sources and methods.\\n\\n\"This is evidently of no consequence to a President who cares about nothing about the country and everything about his narrow self-interest,\" Schiff added.\\n\\nThe president’s order is similar to his February move, when he cleared the way for the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee to release a partisan memo about the surveillance warrant on Carter Page.\\nDemocrats, weeks later, released their own version of the memo.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Hungarian Prime Minister Hits Nail On The Head: Refugees Are Actually \"Muslim Invaders\"\\n\\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban doesn\\'t mince words when it comes to the Muslim invasion in Europe and specifically to his own country.\\nOrban says there is not only Muslim invaders in the mix of \"refugees,\" but also “economic migrants\" seeking better lives for themselves.\\nIndeed, both of these are true.\\nThere are plenty of these people who are simply happy to have a place to live after many were driven from their homes due to the US, Russia and other countries putting their noses where they didn\\'t belong and funding, training and arming Islamic jihadis there.\\nThen, there are those who clearly come to the country to Islamasize the country because they have an Islamic dominionist attitude borne of the teachings of the Koran and Muhammad .\\nRT reports:\\nRefugees in Europe are just “Muslim invaders” and economic migrants seeking better lives, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has said, adding that the large number of Muslims in the EU had led to the appearance of ‘parallel societies.’ Asked in an interview with the German Bild newspaper why Budapest does not want to accept any refugees, Orban replied: “We don’t consider these people to be Muslim refugees.” Instead, the tough-talking politician said they were regarded as “Muslim invaders.” Asylum seekers must cross four countries to reach Hungary from Syria, all of which are not as rich as Germany but are economically stable, the PM said.\\nHe was apparently referring to Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Serbia – a common route for migrants heading for ‘wealthy’ Europe.\\n“So, they are not running for their lives [in these countries].\\nThey are merely economic migrants seeking a better life,” Orban concluded.\\nHe stressed though, that he can only speak for the Hungarians and they “don’t want” immigration.\\nIn his view, the government simply can’t go against the will of the people.\\nAnd Orban has stayed the course, too while governments like that of Germany have ignored their people to allow for a clear invasion of Germany that has led to untold numbers of sexual assaults by Muslim migrants, attacks on Christians and there\\'s no telling the amount of damage to the unethical welfare system in the country.\\nRT continues:\\nGoing further, the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to Portugal, for example, adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous Germany.\\n“The reason why people are in your country is not because they are refugees, but because they want a German life,” he said, describing the issue “politically” as a European problem but, “sociologically,” as a German problem.\\nOrban specifically targeted Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ‘open-door’ policy towards asylum seekers.\\n“I’ve never understood how chaos, anarchy and illegal border crossings are viewed as something good in a country like Germany, which we view as the best example of discipline and the rule of law,” he said.\\nThe recent wave of refugees reaching Europe is merely an invasion, according to Orban.\\n“If someone wants to come to your house, he knocks on your door and asks: ‘Can we come in, can we stay?’ They [asylum seekers] didn’t do that, they crossed the border illegally,” he stated.\\nOrban then did what most political representatives will simply not do, he told the truth about multiculturalism.\\nHe called it an \"illusion\" and said that Christian and Muslim societies “will never unite.”\\nOf course, they won\\'t.\\nThey have absolutely nothing in common.\\nThey cannot agree on God\\'s law, which most Western societies were base on, including the united States.\\nThey cannot agree on the Scriptures.\\nThey cannot agree on the person and work of Jesus the Christ.\\nThey can\\'t even agree on the means of proselytizing and of what real spiritual weapons are.\\nPM Orban has remained consistent.\\nHe has publicly told the Muslim invaders to leave Hungary and never come back.\\nHe has rebuffed Brussels, which is largely Islamic, and told them that Hungary would defend its borders, and it has.\\nOrban\\'s border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99%!\\nHe has genuinely reached out his hand to help Christian migrants instead of Muslim migrants and he seems to be one that holds to the Christian faith, as emulated by the Protestant Reformers, saying, \"That which serves the glory of God is the best for the people.\"\\nFurthermore, Orban has also called out the man behind the curtain in a lot of the promoting of this Muslim invasion of the West, George Soros.\\nAnti-jihadist activist Pamela Geller praised Orban for his honesty and wrote, \"At last, a politician who speaks the truth about the Muslim invasion of Europe.\\nAnd while Orban is right that these are \\'economic migrants,\\' they are also \\'Muslim invaders.\\'\"\\n\"They don’t want a \\'German life\\' in Germany in the sense that they are willing to accept German values,\" she added.\\n\"Many, all too many, of them want to overwhelm German values, and European values in general, with sharia values.\\nThey are in Europe to conquer and Islamize it, with willing and eager help from Europe’s short-sighted, self-serving, internationalist intelligentsia.\"\\nIndeed!\\nThank you Prime Minister Orban for saying what needed to be said!\\n',\n",

Circuit’s decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer’s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant.\\nKavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person’s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn’t constitute a “search” as defined by the Fourth Amendment.\\nTo Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is “constitutional.” In this line of thinking, the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone’s physical property, or track someone’s cell phone.\\nLuckily, he was the only judge on the panel to think this.\\nIn June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant.\\nBut it gets worse.\\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA’s phone metadata collection program, arguing that it is “entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.” To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens’ phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure.\\nSeriously.\\nAccording to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches “without individualized suspicion” when the government demonstrates a “special need” that “outweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.”\\nExactly what this “special need” is that can constitute a Gestapo like police state surveilling its own citizens is a moving target that has already been proven to be abused over and over again.\\n“The sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice,” Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh’s views on the disposable nature of the constitution.\\nKavanaugh “has no qualms about applying decades-old case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a “counterterrorism exception” to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement,” said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program.\\nWhile the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations and the right is attacking the alleged victims, others in Congress who see through the facade and media distraction are trying to draw attention to the fact that Kavanaugh is a champion of the police and surveillance state and an enemy to privacy.\\nRepresentative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed.\\nHowever, this hasn’t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court.\\n“Privacy advocates must fight,” Amash tweeted.\\n“There are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion, guns, and regulations.\\nThe only question is will the Senate confirm one who is really bad on the #4thAmendment, when so much is at stake in upcoming digital privacy battles.”\\nIndeed, as technology increases, so does the desire of the state to use it to spy on us.\\nThe cases headed to the supreme court in the future over what constitutes an unconstitutional search will undoubtedly be vast in number and detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep.\\nAs for if Kavanaugh gets appointed, Amash has some harsh words to those who are blindly supporting him based on party lines:\\n“When Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court, undermining our #4thAmendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures, it will be too late for others to join me.”\\nBelow is a video taken at the Mises Institute of Judge Napolitano explaining the implications of this enemy of the Fourth Amendment on the Supreme Court.\\nJudge Andrew #Napolitano on Brett #Kavanaugh and the #PatriotAct At Mises University, Judge Andrew Napolitano breaks down some of the troubling parts of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's legal career.\\nhttps:\/\/law.justia.com\/cases\/federal\/appellate-courts\/cadc\/15-5307\/15-5307-2015-11-20.htmlLong story short, #Kavanaugh is not a friend to civil liberties or the Constitution.\\nHe helped to uphold the UnConstitutional Patriot Act which of course paved the way for the Indefinte Detention provisions of the NDAA.\\nAuburn, Alabama; 16 July 2018.\\nLink to entire video: https:\/\/youtu.be\/1uTR3qNW70w#StoptheNDAA Posted by People Against the NDAA on Tuesday, September 25, 2018\\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\\n\",\n",

Gottlieb.\\n“For years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called ‘weapons of war,’ and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort.\\n“Under this settlement,” he continued, “the government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case.\\nThey will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech.\\nThat will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.” The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation’s oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing and legal action group focusing on the Constitutional right and heritage to privately own and possess firearms.\\nFounded in 1974, The Foundation has grown to more than 600,000 members and supporters and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control.\\nWhat does all this mean?\\nWell, it\\'s pretty simple, and I highly recommend the Wired article, which is quite lengthy and has lots of information, but what this does is demonstrates that the genie is out of the bottle and there is just no way for gun grabbing Communists the world over to be able to truly enforce their unlawful acts of fun gun confiscation.\\nWhy?\\nBecause now, anyone with access to the internet and a 3D printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered.\\nThat\\'s right, and it\\'s perfectly legal to do so.\\nAnd we aren\\'t just talking a rigid looking one-shot handgun.\\nWe\\'re talking ARs, 1911s and a host of other guns.\\nThis actually may end up undermining the gun manufacturing industry in the future, as people will be able to build their own guns at home in a similar manner to how the internet has had a dramatic effect on the retail brick and mortar stores.\\nWilson boasted that his efforts have officially killed gun control.\\n\"I barely put a million bucks into this and I got you the Second Amendment forever,\" he told The Daily Wire in a phone interview.\\n\"What has the NRA done for you lately?\"\\nI don\\'t know that I would go quite that far, after all, the settlement does state that \"the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military.\"\\nTherefore, the government still believes it has a right to regulate certain arms, which it does not have authority to do.\\n\"This doesn’t put the rifle in everyone’s hand, but it does that in essence\" he added.\\n\"The DNA of our culture is preserved.\\nThis is the first pillar in the internet gun culture of tomorrow, and it is permanent.\"\\nThis is a huge milestone in the history of our county, and as such, it should be celebrated as a victory.\\nAs Joe Wolverton of The New American writes:\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick\\'s Scandal\\n\\nArchbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul, MN, responds to the McCarrick scandal (The Catholic Spirit):\\nEvery time Mass is celebrated, the priest prays that Jesus will “look not on our sins but on the faith of [his] Church… .” That’s been an important prayer for me in the time that I have been serving this archdiocese, well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church.\\nI’ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face-to-face with its sins, with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century, has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests.\\nTo make matters worse (if that is even possible), evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop, as well as some priests and laity, had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of Church authorities but to no avail: Archbishop McCarrick was nonetheless “promoted” to become the archbishop in our nation’s capital, and elevated to the College of Cardinals.\\nWhile I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations, and that there’s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don’t, I don’t think that the Church in the United States will rest — and confidence will be restored — until the matter is independently investigated and explained, and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn’t happen again.\\nThe matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here.\\nIt was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick.\\nA number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part, inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick, or if I knew of any allegations against him.\\nI can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York.\\nWhat I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers.\\nWhen serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press).\\nBy the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013, the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history.\\nIt would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick.\\nYears before I ever lived in Newark, and never imagining that I would be assigned there, I had indeed read — as a somewhat geeky ex-lawyer — an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers, Cardinal Eagan, Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers.\\nWhile the complaint didn’t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation.\\nKnowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence.\\nI can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him.\\nI heard lots of gut-wrenching stories in my two-and-a-half years there, but none of them involved Archbishop McCarrick.\\nWith St. John Paul II’s 1995 visit, he was remembered for “bringing a saint to Newark,” not as an abuser of seminarians, minors or priests.\\nWhen I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew.\\nI can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.\\nWhile the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there’s still a long way to go in restoring trust, I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you, the faithful of this archdiocese.\\nThe events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law, regardless of rank or privilege.\\nI was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct.\\nOur heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that “where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.” May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church.\\nREMNANT COMMENT: While we certainly appreciate His Excellency\\'s candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the Church, we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the Church\\'s official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the so-called \"gay lifestyle,\" which includes her long-held teaching that homosexual activity between clerics is an ecclesiastical crime.\\nFar from being reassured of this by their bishops, many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an \"inclusive community\" that \"welcomes all\" and \"judges none.\"\\nAll very well and good, except for the fact that the Church\\'s constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance.\\nIn fact, this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism, which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops:\\nHomosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that \"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\"\\nThey are contrary to the natural law.\\nThey close the sexual act to the gift of life.\\nThey do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.\\nUnder no circumstances can they be approved.\\n(Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)\\nUnder no circumstances…except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ-friendly or not.\\nEven Pope John Paul \"The GREAT\\'s\" Vatican clarified the Church\\'s teaching on October 31, 1986, in the “Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons”:\\nAlthough the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.\\nTherefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option.\\nIt is not.\\nNotice the late pope does not say, “Let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful,” as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media.\\nDoes Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously doesn\\'t care about her or the moral code by which she governs?\\nDoes he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment...or just the straight Catholics?\\nDoes His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our \"Catholic Christian\" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?\\nPope John Paul certainly didn\\'t accept that.\\nIn his 2005 book Memory and Identity, John Paul referred to homosexuality as an “ideology of evil,” insisting of so-called \\'gay marriage\\' that:\\n“It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man.”\\nWas Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe?\\nAre Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope, saint, and moral theologian in history?\\nOr is it not so that it is both negligent and uncharitable for some bishops to refuse to inform their faithful that according to the Church\\'s own infallible teaching, everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration?\\nAnd if the episcopal retort is going to be that this acceptance refers only to chaste homosexuals, then we call FOUL even louder since this crosses the line into willful deception.\\nWe\\'re all sinners, of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are, just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh.\\nSo why are our bishops playing dumb?\\nQuite obviously, it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinning--and sinning proudly.\\nThis is what the Church of Accompaniment is all about!\\nBut, practically speaking--in the real world--this kind of \"accompaniment\" is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin, and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests.\\nSo what\\'s going on here?\\nWho are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?\\nIs it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the \"gay lifestyle\" and violations of the Sixth Commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that Scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance?\\nThe Catholic Church\\'s new-found \"climate of tolerance\" is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on!\\nIt is truly homophobic for any bishop to lie to the gay community about this, and to risk the immortal souls of the sheep merely so that the shepherd might pride himself on occupying the politically correct high ground.\\nThis is gross dereliction of duty, and we hope and pray that all the good U.S. bishops would jump at the opportunity to issue statements reaffirming the Church\\'s clear teaching against all sins of the flesh, homo- and heterosexual.\\nAgain, God bless Archbishop Hebda for this welcome statement, and may God grant him the courage now to finish the task by publicly reassuring the scandalized faithful that it’s not just abuse of minors or sexual harassment that’s going on here.\\nOur bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church\\'s moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness.\\nAnd neither can God\\'s law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our “most enlightened” age---which is, of course, an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting.\\nUntil the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy.\\nMcCarrick will become the norm, not the exception, and confidence in the leadership and moral authority of the Catholic Church will remain in the toilet indefinitely... exactly as the forces of darkness intended all along.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Why Louis Farrakhan Is Back in the News\\n\\nLouis Farrakhan, the 84-year-old head of the Nation of Islam, has been back in the headlines after a previously unreleased photo of him with President Barack Obama was published in January and Mr. Farrakhan gave an anti-Semitic speech at his organization’s annual convention last month.\\n\\nThe Feb. 25 speech, which was given at an event for Saviour’s Day, a religious gathering of the Nation, ran for almost three hours.\\nDuring it, Mr. Farrakhan said that the “powerful Jews” were his enemies, and that Jews were “responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men,” as well as other incendiary remarks.\\n\\nA religious fundamentalist whose group has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mr. Farrakhan is fervently opposed to the legitimacy of the state of Israel, and his political positions regarding the country frequently spill over into bigoted remarks about Jews, which is why many public officials have avoided association with him.\\nMr. Farrakhan has denied that he is anti-Semitic and has even said that his father may have been Jewish.\\n\\nMuch of the recent coverage has been focused on Tamika Mallory, one of the heads of the Women’s March organization, who attended the Feb. 25 speech, and on Representative Danny Davis, a Democrat of Illinois, who defended Mr. Obama and Mr. Farrakhan after the photo came to light.\\nTheir reluctance to condemn Mr. Farrakhan has led to criticism from across the ideological spectrum this week.\\n\\nWhat is the Nation of Islam?\\nThe Nation of Islam is a political and religious movement that was started by W.D.\\nFard Muhammad in 1931 and continued by Elijah Muhammad in 1933.\\nIt first became prominent after a man named Malcolm Little joined the organization.\\nEncouraged by Elijah Muhammad, he changed his last name to X and became a minister in the movement.\\n\\nEdward E. Curtis IV, the author of “Black Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,” said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s.\\nBut he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement’s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali.\\n\\nWho is Louis Farrakhan?\\nBorn Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X.\\nAfter the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.\\n\\nThe Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and ’50s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism.\\nIt was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on “the white man” as “the white devil”).\\nBut in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians.\\nThat political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism.\\n(Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as “a very great man.”)\\n\\nIn 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions.\\nThe faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad.\\nMr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers.\\nMr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is “virtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,” then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\\n\\nIn a radio address, he urged listeners to “make an example” of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private.\\nMr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister’s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well.\\n\\nHe was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the “Million Man March,” a political and religious revival event in Washington.\\n\\nWhy were Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis reluctant to denounce him?\\nMs. Mallory, who declined to comment for this article, did not respond to calls to condemn Mr. Farrakhan, for whom she had expressed admiration in the past.\\n\\nOn March 3, she said on Twitter that someone had brought to her attention that she had yet to tweet “my absolute position on how wrong anti-Semitism is.” A day later, she said that she was “committed to ending anti-black racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia & transphobia,” but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\\n\\nIn an essay posted Wednesday, she said that she had been attending Saviour’s Day celebrations for over 30 years.\\n\\n“In that most difficult period of my life, it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,” she said.\\nThe essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\\nAsked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan’s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents.\\n\\n“For those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,” Mr. Curtis said.\\n\\nYvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore who called Mr. Farrakhan’s remarks about Jews “unbelievably vile,” emphasized that his fundamentalism was comparable to the fundamentalist views found in other religions.\\n\\nCoincidentally, the photo of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Obama had been published by the Trice Edney News Wire in January.\\nThe News Wire reported that the picture had been taken by the photojournalist Askia Muhammad during a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus and that Mr. Muhammad kept the photo under wraps so as not to hurt Mr. Obama’s candidacy.\\n\\n(Mr. Muhammad, in a 2012 blog post, said that he was an admirer of Mr. Farrakhan and that the minister was not an anti-Semite.\\nHe reaffirmed that he admired Mr. Farrakhan in an interview on Friday, though he said that the things the minister says about Jewish people “sometimes make me shudder.”)\\n\\nKatie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said on Friday: “President Obama has denounced racism and anti-Semitism his entire life.\\nThat includes his public and repeated repudiations of Louis Farrakhan’s views over the years.\\nToday is no different — he still rejects the harmful and divisive views Farrakhan continues to espouse.”\\n\\nRepresentative Davis, who was interviewed by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, after the photo emerged, called Mr. Farrakhan an “outstanding human being,” and later said he was not bothered by the leader’s position on “The Jewish Question.”\\n\\nAfter a monthlong backlash about that interview, largely in conservative media, Mr. Davis said in a statement to Forward on Thursday that “I reject, condemn and oppose Minister Farrakhan’s views and remarks regarding the Jewish people and the Jewish religion.”\\n',\n",

a second Operation Wetback, including E-Verify, to get the illegal alien self-deporting; a moratorium on legal immigration.\\nMay 2018 was the fifth consecutive month in which the foreign-born working age population (including illegals) grew by more than 1 million from the same month the prior year.\\nBut May’s growth was less than that in April and March, possibly an emerging trend.\\nCan't render, error\\nIn May 2018 there were 1.342 million more working-age immigrants than in May 2017.\\nThis comes on the heels of gains of 2.154 million and 1.597 million.\\nyear-over-year, in March and April, respectively.\\nIt’s hard to believe with the evaporation of the Trump Effect, but less than six months ago we were seeing to year-over-year declines in the immigrant workforce population.\\nThe last five months of 2017 saw the foreign-born population fall by an average 100,000 from the same month of the prior year (shown in red on our chart).\\nThese are net figures.\\nOver a 12-month period an average of perhaps 300,000 immigrants die and an equal number leave the U.S. voluntarily.\\nSo the 1.342 million net rise in foreign-born population, May 2017 to May 2018, implies that nearly 2 million foreign-born individuals may have actually settled in the country over those 12 months.\\n(This excludes tourists and other short-term entrants.)\\nIn percentage terms, the immigrant working-age population grew 3.24% over the 12 months.\\nIf this growth rate persists, it portends a doubling in 22 years.\\nBy contrast, the native-born American population rose 0.63% over this period —a rate that will require 114 years for a doubling.\\nIf both rates persist that long, the term “native born” will refer to a minuscule fraction of the U.S. population.\\nAnother way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment:\\nCan't render, error\\nImmigrants accounted for 17.36% of total employment in May.\\nNote that, while significantly below the all-time high of 18.1% recorded in April, the May figure is third highest among the 113 months for which we have data.\\nA detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report.\\nEmployment Status by Nativity, May 2017- May 2018 (numbers in 1000s;

Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\\nFor I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\\nAnd the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\\nAnd the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.\\nAnd Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\\nPeradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?\\nThat be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\\nAnd the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\\nAnd Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?\\nAnd he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.\\nAnd he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there.\\nAnd he said, I will not do it for forty\\'s sake.\\nAnd he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.\\nAnd he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\\nAnd he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.\\nAnd he said, I will not destroy it for twenty\\'s sake.\\nAnd he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.\\nAnd he said, I will not destroy it for ten\\'s sake.\\nAnd the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\"\\n-Genesis 18:16-33\\nGot questions.org explains very well…\\nGenesis chapter 19 records the two angels, disguised as human men, visiting Sodom and Gomorrah.\\nLot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house.\\nThe angels agreed.\\nThe Bible then informs us, \"Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom — both young and old — surrounded the house.\\nThey called to Lot, \\'Where are the men who came to you tonight?\\nBring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\\nGenesis 19:4-5 The angels then proceed to blind all the men of Sodom and Gomorrah and urge Lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that God was about to deliver.\\nLot and his family flee the city, and then \"the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah — from the LORD out of the heavens.\\nThus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities...\" (Genesis 19:2 4) .\\nIn light of the passage, the most common response to the question, \"What was the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah?\"\\nis that it was homosexuality.\\nThat is how the term ”sodomy” came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men, whether consensual or forced.\\nClearly, homosexuality was part of the reason God destroyed the two cities.\\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah wanted to perform homosexual gang rape on the two angels, who were disguised as men.\\nAt the same time, it is not biblical to say that homosexuality was the exclusive reason why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.\\nThe cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged.\\nEzekiel 16:49-50 declares, \"Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.\\nThey were haughty and did detestable things before me...\" The Hebrew word translated \"detestable\" refers to something that is morally disgusting and is the exact same word used in Leviticus 18:22 that refers to homosexuality as an \"abomination.\"\\nSimilarly, Jude 7 declares, \"...Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.\"\\nSo, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities.\\nThose who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality.\\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly being inhospitable.\\nThere is probably nothing more inhospitable than homosexual gang rape.\\nBut to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point.\\nWhile Sodom and Gomorrah were guilty of many other horrendous sins, homosexuality was the reason God poured fiery sulfur on the cities, completely destroying them and all of their inhabitants.\\nTo this day, the area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland.\\nSodom and Gomorrah serve as a powerful example of how God feels about sin in general, and homosexuality specifically.\\nThe point is that there were no righteous to be spared and the Lord did what man failed to do when they had the time to do it.\\nQuestion: How do you show mercy to a people who observe lying vanities (Jonah 2:4) and refuse to return to the Lord (Jeremiah 6:16) on His terms?\\n(Jeremiah 22:3) God must be true and judgment must commence.\\nMen today, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, are not valiant for the truth.\\nThey are valiant to proceed from evil to evil (Jeremiah 5).\\nThey care more about the pleasures of sin for a season, than they are grieved for the afflictions of Joseph (Amos 6:6; Hebrews 11:25).\\nMen today care more of compromise (where two men both agree on what they both know is wrong) and diplomacy (seduction in another guise) in promoting anarchy through “antinomianism” than they do the Law of God against the sins unto judgment that enslave men (John 8:34).\\nInstead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good (Amos 5:15) in hopes that the Lord may be gracious to their repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10), they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil, and that to their own damnation.\\nThey care more about the approbation and favor of men than they do that of the Living God and what His Word declares (Galatians 1:10),not knowing that which his highly favored among men is an abomination unto the Lord (Luke 16:15).\\nThey wear the cross.\\nYet, they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what Christ required: “Deny yourselves and take up your cross and follow Me” (Matthew 16:24; Romans 1:16; 2 Corinthians 5:15, 13:4-5; Galatians 2:21).\\nProfessed Christians in America today talk much of love through inaction, and yet know nothing of it (1 John 3:18).\\nThey read what to do, but do it not!\\nIn fact, they declare and proclaim how much they love God, and yet if you were to have them read His moral law and look to their own lives, they would find how much they actually hate God through their actions (Matthew 15:8).\\nThen again, these were the same types of people in Jerusalem crying out \"Crucify him!\\nCrucify him!\\nWe have no king but Caesar\" (John 19:15).\\nAnd these are the same people today persecuting living Christians while praising the dead ones (Matthew 5:10).\\nThey continuously preach of the heroism of Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, Gideon, Samson and others from the pulpit and fail to understand what these men were doing when serving their generations (Psalm 71:18-19; Isaiah 51:4).\\nToday, instead of doing the same, they simply hide under a false grace (Isaiah 30) and give themselves over to a man, the president, and declare end times.\\nThey declare we\\'re in the end times because they have failed to stand up and fight for their posterity in keeping the Lord\\'s commandments and His judgments (Psalm 78:1-11).\\nUngrateful reprobates, pretenders, counterfeits and hypocrites are what they are (Matthew 23:3).\\nInstead of reaching out to the greatest demographic here in America, public high schools, they send missionaries to foreign lands to do there what they fail to do for their own here.\\nInstead of fighting for their posterity and shutting down the illegalities of sodomy in all 50 states, they teach them to just do their best to understand that they cannot help themselves while God say’s the opposite (Leviticus 20:18).\\nInstead of fighting on their behalf against the federal government that is illegally indoctrinating them, they simply give their kids over to them to be dumbed down.\\nAnd instead of protesting the murder of 58 million innocent babies (Proverbs 6:17), they merely pass it off as a \"choice,\" that being the lessons that they learned from the media that they say that they do not believe (Romans 1:18).\\nThe American Church, instead of protesting corruption in government through the example of the Biblical patriarchs and our American forefathers (Matthew 5:17-18), teach to submit to tyranny as if to suggest that it is somehow obedience to God (Romans 12:21).\\nThe Church in America has failed to keep the Commandments of the God of Israel.\\nInstead of preaching out against sin, they advocate for that which God clearly condemns, thereby making war against God (Micah 3:5), which at length destroys our government, our country and our families.\\nLook to their feigned strength that they profess to possess.\\nIt is gauged by simply looking to the prevailing immoralities and debauchers of society.\\nThey are weak and pathetic and they have no excuses as to why America is where we is today!\\nWhy did God judge Sodom and Gomorrah?\\nIt\\'s the same reason that he is judging America today (Amos 4:12), He cannot find the righteous in order to spare her (Jeremiah 22:3).\\nDefining the Wicked…\\nWicked men in the sight of God are those who have the knowledge of what to do when it comes to the right, but over and over again, they turn their shoulders and choose the wrong, through tolerance and apathy Americans are bringing upon themselves destruction (Deuteronomy 30:19) that will not be reversed, which leaves no alternative as to why God judges and is judging America today (Deuteronomy 28:63).\\nArticle posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)\\n\\nTO ARGUE AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY is to contend with constituted reality.\\nEver since Adam and Eve committed the Original Sin, every living creature is subject to it.\\nEvery one of us is born on Death Row and lives out his allotted lifespan in its shadow without hope of reprieve.\\nGod made that clear when He told Adam that “in what day soever” he preferred his own will above his Creator’s, “thou shalt die the death,” condemning him sooner or later to “return to the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return” (Gen. 3:19).\\nIn other words, there has always been a death penalty.\\nGod instituted it, and He was the first to impose it, embedding it in the very fabric of natural law.\\nWhen Cain took it upon himself to inflict death on his brother Abel “in the field,” he soon learned that God furthermore reserved the exercise of this right to himself alone.\\nCain is told, “What hast thou done?\\nThe voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the earth,” and God curses him for his presumption by dooming him to homelessness and unproductive labor.\\nWhen Cain complains that being a “vagabond .\\n.\\n.\\non the earth, every one therefore that findeth me, shall kill me,” God laid down that “whoever shall kill Cain shall be punished sevenfold,” setting a mysterious identifying mark on him to protect him from the vengeance of others.\\nThe Fifth Commandment later delivered to Moses, “Thou shalt not kill,” therefore dates from adamic times, when it operated as God’s exclusive prerogative, allowing no exceptions.\\n\\nAlthough men certainly continued to kill one another in a society which in fact became so wicked \"that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,\" they did so as murderers, outside God\\'s law without legal right.\\nOnly after the Flood, when Noah and his sons set about repopulating the earth, did God delegate to human society His exclusive authority to impose the death penalty for just cause.\\nHe told Noah, “For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.\\nWhosoever shall shed man’s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.” In other words, from that point in history lawful killing in atonement for taking the life of another is sanctioned by God.\\n\\nAfter the great theophany on Sinai, Moses codified the death penalty as part of the old law of talion, which in strict justice required “life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot” (Deut.\\n19:21).\\nThe supreme penalty was imposed not only for murder, but for many other serious offenses: for adultery, rape, sodomy, kidnapping, for striking or cursing parents, for sacrificing a child to Moloch.\\nIdolatry, fortune-telling, acting as a medium, preaching apostasy or attempting in any way to entice another from the faith were also punishable by death, as was blasphemy, an offense considered so heinous that the Law specified, “He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger” (Lev.\\n24:16).\\nDeath was also decreed for refusing to accept the decision of the priests in a legal case, and an incorrigible son could be put to death on the testimony of his parents before the proper court.\\n\\nA priest’s daughter convicted of fornication was burned to death (Lev.\\n21:9), but usually the sentence was carried out by stoning, in which the whole community took part as evidence that no private parties were authorized to execute a criminal, but only society as a whole, after due judgment.\\nEveryone was furthermore responsible for the atonement due to God for a crime whose evil consequences would otherwise have affected them all: “The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people; that thou mayest take away the evil out of the midst of thee” (Deut.\\n17:7).\\nThe Law read, “Defile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another” (Num.\\n35:33).\\n\\nIn order to emphasize the fact that it is God, and not man, who is always the principal party to be avenged, provision was made for a heifer to be killed as propitiation in the case of an unsolved murder whose perpetrator could not be found (Deut.\\n20:1-9).\\nAfter all, it is not the injury to relatives or any other human consideration that makes homicide the serious sin that it is, but as God Himself pointed out to Noah, it is the fact that “man was made to the image of God” that makes an assault on him tantamount to an assault on God.\\nIt is therefore to God, and not to His creatures that reparation is primarily due.\\nThis point was brought out by Pope Pius XII in an address to Italian Catholic jurists on May 12, 1954, when he said:\\nA penalty is the reaction required by law and justice in response to a fault: penalty and fault are action and reaction.\\nOrder violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and re-establishment of the disturbed equilibrium .\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nA word must be said on the full meaning of penalty.\\nMost of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection, that is, defense of the community against criminal undertakings, and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law.\\nIn those theories, the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law, so as to teach the guilty to live honestly, but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed, which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty .\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nIn the metaphysical order, penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will, dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being.\\nIf it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and re-establish the violated law, it is when that is required by the supreme Judge and supreme Justice.\\nToday the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely, even in cases of proven premeditated murder.\\nDespite the fact that it was instituted by God Himself, growing numbers of Catholics actually consider it immoral.\\nJohn Paul II, stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle, has declared that it should be imposed very seldom, if ever.\\nBut doesn’t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice?\\nIn the U.S., following the lead of the late Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago and like minded prelates won to the new man-centered conciliar religion, the faithful are beginning to equate abortion, nuclear war and capital punishment as common “threats to the sacredness of human life” without any reference whatever to the innocence or guilt involved.\\nIf they are aware that the Church has upheld from Apostolic times the right to use force in self-defense, to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime, they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by Dei Verbum at the Second Vatican Council that the unchanging Catholic “tradition which comes from the Apostles” actually “develops in the Church” and keeps pace with changing times (II,8).\\n\\nThe circumstances pertaining to our day would therefore dictate a reassessment of the death penalty, which the new man-centered theology insists on viewing almost exclusively from the standpoint of the criminal and human society rather than from God’s.\\nAt the same time, there is more and more discussion about society’s responsibility for having produced criminals in the first place, together with our moral obligation to rehabilitate them rather than to wreak what is now considered a form of fruitless, guilty “vengeance” on them.\\nThe idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing.\\n\\nAccording to one widely held opinion, the death penalty has proved to be no effective deterrent to crime in any case, and should be discarded as impractical.\\nWhat proof of this can possibly be offered?\\nHow can we know?\\nDeterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case, yet Scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty.\\nTo a man proven to have given false witness against another, Deuteronomy laid down, “They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother.\\n.\\n.\\nthat others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things.\\nThou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot” (Deut.\\n19:19-21).\\nAnd the Preacher notes that when “sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear” (Eccles.\\n8:11).\\n\\nTo illustrate how shallow Catholic thinking on the death penalty has become and how far it has deviated from the age-old doctrine of the Church, a priest of a presumably traditional Catholic Fraternity writes in answer to a query addressed to him on the subject by saying:\\nThe death penalty is based on the common teachings of theologians, but is not itself a declared dogma.\\nTherefore it is not permissible to call those who hold it is, immoral heretics.\\nTo approach this as a dogmatic teaching is imprudent.\\nThose who argue for its abolition do not necessarily put society in danger considering possibilities of penal systems.\\nThose, however, who maintain its continued use often see it more as a tool for revenge.\\nPlease consider that in anger and tragedy, the desire for revenge usually overrides reason and an honest answering of the question “must this person’s life be taken to preserve society?” The desire for swift and firm convictions has sent many to death who never deserved such a punishment, nor was such a punishment truly necessary for the safety of society.\\nI do not believe the death penalty is necessary in 90 percent of the cases where it is applied.\\nThus to call for a moratorium .\\n.\\n.\\nis not unjust or incorrect.\\nThat the death penalty can become an instrument of revenge, and that unjust sentences are sometimes handed down can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument.\\nGiven the fallen human condition, such injustices are bound to occur in any judicial system, and everyone agrees that they should be ruthlessly remedied.\\nWhat is not irrelevant is that the author of the letter falls headlong into the very error Pius XII warns against.\\nConsidering the physical safety of society as the only real reason for executing a criminal, he feels the death penalty can now be safely discarded, allegedly on the grounds that we now have at our disposal many better ways of protecting people from him.\\nThat the penalty is due primarily as expiation to God in justice, and only secondarily to man has been lost sight of altogether.\\nThe supernatural dimension of the punishment as an agent for the spiritual good of both society and the criminal is furthermore not only not addressed, but treated as non-existent.\\nThis first appeared in The Remnant nearly 20 years ago.\\nIsn\\'t it time to subscribe to the \\'paper of record\\' for the traditional Catholic counterrevolution?\\n\\nThe source of this kind of materialistic thinking in the Church is not hard to trace.\\nAccording to statistics published in the National Review for September 16, 1983, out of 9,140 murders committed in the U.S. in 1960 just before the Council, 56 persons were executed.\\nIn 1965, the year the Council closed, although the tally of murders had risen to 9,850, only 7 were executed.\\nIn the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place.\\nAt its close the number of murders had more than doubled, and in any six month period, more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century.\\nAt this point, although the murder rate has continued to rise dramatically, executions continue to be rare.\\nMany nations, notably England, France, Sweden, South Africa and our neighbors Canada and Mexico, have abolished the death penalty altogether.\\nWhether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen.\\n\\nWhat leaps to the eye from the mounting statistics is that decline in the exercise of the death penalty has kept close pace with decline in the Faith and church attendance.\\nIt is sober fact that death sentences were liberally handed out in the heyday of Christendom, when the Faith was strong and governments legislated with an eye to the spiritual welfare of citizens whose sights were primarily on future bliss in heaven.\\nIn modern times, which find the Church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government, secularism has become the state religion, directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives.\\nIt is only to be expected that materialists—for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has—should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him.\\nIn their eyes this means total extinction, a penalty certainly in excess of any transgression of which he may be guilty.\\n\\nNot even God completely obliterates a human existence, not even for the most odious sins, for He made the human soul immortal and hell eternal.\\n(It might be argued, however, that if the criminal is thought to have to have totally terminated his victim, why not do the same to him?)\\nIn the days of Christendom, condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God, in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose.\\nJustice was served, but not at the expense of charity, and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit.\\nNor was the idea of “rehabilitation” with possible re-entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned.\\nIt has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance, whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins.\\n\\nAs it is, the death penalty as administered by society must be viewed against the backdrop of divine revelation if it is to make any real sense.\\nWhen Catholic society puts a man to death, it terminates only his temporal life on earth, catapulting him into eternity for his final judgment before almighty God.\\nSuffering the penalty not only allows the criminal to render expiation to God and to society, but if accepted in Christ’s grace with due repentance, it preserves his soul from hell and eliminates much of his purgatory.\\nIf his contrition is perfect, it’s conceivable that he could go straight to heaven!\\nIn any case, neither he nor society is any longer burdened with the guilt of his wrongdoing.\\n\\nAs Michel Martin pointed out in an article in Rome et d’Ailleurs for September-October 1983, “The truth is that the problem of the death penalty is insoluble except from a Christian point of view.” That it figured so prominently in Christian societies is due to the fact that, in the order of charity, atonement to God was sought above any atonement due to man, and the spiritual welfare of citizens above their physical well-being.\\nModern secularized society assumes that physical extinction is the worst thing that can happen to a human being, whereas the faith teaches that eternal damnation is incalculably worse.\\nIn the context of the faith, the importance of a man’s present short life on earth cannot be compared with his future endless existence in heaven.\\n+++\\nAs we have seen, the death penalty has a very long history.\\nDating from its institution by God in Eden to its delegation after the Flood to men who would wield it in God’s name, it has threaded its way without interruption through the fabric of human civilizations until these latter days.\\nOne might expect that after the Incarnation, when God became man and replaced the Old Testament’s law of talion based on strict justice with a new dispensation based on love and grace, the death penalty could be safely abolished as outmoded.\\nConverts to the prevailing conciliar religion and its “New Pentecost” would in fact argue in this wise, perhaps citing the Council’s famous declaration in Gaudium et Spes that, “Thanks to the experience of past ages ...the nature of man himself is more clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened,” and the world now has “a keener awareness of human dignity” ( 44, 73).\\n\\nFar from obliterating the death penalty, however, the Incarnation only laid bare its deepest significance, hidden from the beginning.\\nAs the new dispensation’s foremost theologian, St. Paul would declare, the old penalty remained very much in force: “Almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.” It is still “appointed for men once to die, and after this the judgment” (Heb.\\n9: 22,27), but now with the possibility of eternal bliss in heaven.\\nThis possibility is owed, furthermore, to a death by one of the cruelest means ever devised, unjustly inflicted on one supremely innocent Man who was God, in a miscarriage of human justice beyond any the world could ever have imagined.\\nWhen God set the death penalty in Eden He pronounced it on Himself, to be carried out in the fullness of time through the malicious free wills of his own creatures.\\nThe Cross which was its instrument is the very sign of Christianity, the only means of salvation.\\n\\nNot even from the Cross did Christ decry the death penalty, either for himself or for the two thieves crucified with Him.\\nIt would continue to be dealt out to men by other men on earth, with only one significant change: Henceforth it would be administered under the authority of the glorified man who is Christ the King, as part and parcel of that universal power “in heaven and on earth” which He received from His Father (Matt.\\n28:18) after His Resurrection.\\nFrom that point on it is Christ who delegates the divine authority to punish by killing, and both Scripture and tradition testify that it is lawfully wielded by those to whom He entrusts the temporal sword in His Kingdom.\\nAs He told Pontius Pilate at the time of His trial, “Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above” (John 19:10).\\n\\nPope Leo XIII re-affirmed this truth in Sapientiae Christianae in 1890, when he declared that “true and legitimate authority is devoid of sanction unless it proceed from God the supreme Ruler and Lord of all.\\nThe Almighty alone can commit power to a man over his fellow men.” Even though they may be unaware of the true source of their power, it is always the duty of legitimate authorities to ensure public order by punishing evil-doers, by death if appropriate.\\nAs St. Paul said:\\nTherefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist purchase to themselves eternal damnation.\\nFor rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil.\\n.\\n.\\nFor he is the minister of God to thee for good.\\nBut if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain.\\nFor he is the minister of God: and avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil (Rom.\\n13:2-4).\\nSufficient of itself to expiate every sin which the children of Adam could ever commit, the execution of the Man-God nevertheless did not abolish the penalty of death.\\nIt continues to be the wages of sin (Rom 6:23), and men must still submit to it sooner or later by forfeiting their lives, either willingly or unwillingly.\\nA share in making restitution for sin was thus accorded to all of us, for although our Lord’s ignominious death removed from us the guilt of the original transgression through Baptism, it did not remove its effects.\\nThese were allowed to remain as restraints on men who, now raised to a new supernatural existence, were capable of committing incalculably more grievous sins than heretofore.\\nAs for the death penalty, it remains the inescapable consequence of our fallen nature and is of the highest utility in deterring us from following our hereditary inclination to evil.\\n\\nWhat Christ did was to sanctify the death penalty, transforming it into a sacrament of life for those who believe.\\nAs St. Paul declared, “Death is swallowed up in victory.\\nO death, where is thy victory?\\nO death, where is thy sting?.\\n.\\n.\\nFor by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.\\nAnd as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive” (1 Cor.\\n15: 54-55; 21-22).\\nThe first of that numberless host of Christian martyrs who would be put to death by constituted authority for testifying to the truth, Christ commanded His disciples to “Follow me!” Inviting all to Calvary to “suffer under Pontius Pilate” with Him, He granted a meritorious share in accomplishing “the mystery which hath been hidden for ages and generations, but is now made manifest to his saints” to all who, like St. Paul, would “now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things which are wanting of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for his body which is the church.\\n.\\n.” (Col. 1:26, 24).\\n\\nCriminals put to death undergo a penalty no different from the one exacted from the most innocent amongst us.\\nAs with everyone else the moment of death ushers them either into heaven, hell or purgatory.\\nThe most that can be said is that their lives here on earth are shortened, and they must settle their accounts sooner than expected.\\nThis could be a great mercy for them as well as for society, both in terms of expiation and protection from any future crimes they might have perpetrated.\\nThe death penalty, from the first one imposed on man by God in the beginning in Eden, to the one imposed on God by man on that Good Friday in Jerusalem, on down to those still being imposed today, transcends human legislation.\\nBy divine decree it will perdure until the end of time, when “the former things are passed away.” Only then “death shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more,” and not one minute sooner.\\n(Apo.\\n21:4).\\n',\n",

wounded, the savagery of the Vegas attack is unspeakable, and still the incompetent, clueless authorities know nothing.\\nThat’s the information they seek to blackout.\\nThis botched investigation is a stunning indictment of the FBI.\\nThis is not the Soviet Union, this is not Iran or Riyadh – this is America.\\nWhere is the outrage?\\nAnd while the bumbling FBI has dismissed out of hand jihad as a motive, here is what we know:\\nISIS has claimed responsibility for the Vegas slaughter.\\nISIS does not claim credit for events that are not theirs.\\nThey have double and tripled down on their claim.\\nThey have said that Stephen Paddock had converted to Islam six months ago, and they revealed his Islamic name as Abu Abd Abdulbar al Ameriki.\\nPaddock made multiple trips to the Middle East.\\nThe FBI has not spoken of his itinerary or who he met with.\\nHis girlfriend Mari Danley had relatives in Dubai.\\nOver 200 of Paddock’s foreign financial transactions were flagged for possible covert terrorism financing.\\nPaddock transferred $100,000 to his girlfriend in the Philippines, now an ISIS foothold.\\nPaddock removed the hard drive before he committed suicide.\\nThe San Bernardino jihad attackers did the same thing.\\nIf you recall, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik threw their hard drives in a lake near their home, and despite Herculean efforts by law enforcement, the hard drives were never recovered.\\nAUTHORITIES PUT BRAKES ON INFORMATION FLOW IN LAS VEGAS SHOOTING By Rachel Crosby Las Vegas Review-Journal, October 26, 2017: Fifty-eight people killed.\\nMore than 500 injured.\\nAnd yet, nearly a month after the Las Vegas Strip experienced the worst mass shooting in modern American history, local and federal authorities are refusing to fill in the blanks.\\nIt wasn’t always like this.\\nIn the days after Oct. 1, when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd from his Mandalay Bay corner suite, Las Vegas police were hosting multiple news conferences a day.\\nThen, once a day.\\nThen, once every few days.\\nThey compiled and released snippets of officers’ body camera footage.\\nThey spent several minutes answering specific questions.\\nThey released a comprehensive timeline, which ended up being wrong.\\nThey took it back, and tried to clarify the errors, but instead caused more confusion.\\nBy Oct. 13 — the last time the Metropolitan Police Department or the FBI addressed the media or public — something had changed.\\nThe sheriff, who had been straightforward and stern, was now emotional and at times combative.\\nBoth he and the FBI failed to provide much new information, and at the end of the meeting, they refused to take questions.\\nSince that day, the only person who has shed more light on the investigation is Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg while approaching the gunman’s room.\\nHis platform to share that information?\\n“The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” which aired last week.\\nHe hasn’t made himself available to the media since.\\n“It doesn’t matter,” FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday, when asked why there had been no significant updates in two weeks.\\n“It’s an ongoing investigation, and unless there’s something to report, there will not be a briefing.” Calls to the national FBI office were forwarded back to Breault at the Las Vegas office.\\nAt least twice this week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal has asked to speak with Sheriff Joe Lombardo about the shooting investigation.\\nBoth times, reporters were told by Carla Alston, the Police Department’s director of communications, that the sheriff “will not be conducting interviews.” “As he has stated previously, the case is still ongoing” she said in an email Thursday.\\n“Another media briefing will be held when we have new and accurate information.” When asked when that briefing would be, Alston guessed it could occur in the next two weeks.\\nThe Review-Journal also specifically asked about the more than 50,000 hours of overtime that Metro officers have logged since Oct. 1 on work directly related to the shooting investigation.\\n“Investigators have made progress on investigative leads and in mapping out Stephen Paddock’s life for the last few years — and they’re still not done,” Alston said.\\n“We still have officers dedicated to this case 24\/7.” She agreed that members of the public have a right to know more, “but they have a right to accurate information and not the speculation … that has filled so many news stories the past month.” Nearly a month after the mass shooting, the gunman’s motive remains a mystery.\\nMore straightforward questions also remain unanswered, including whether the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay — where the gunman was staying — has surveillance cameras, and what exactly investigators collected in the gunman’s hotel room and homes.\\nAuthorities also have not said how long the gunman had a “do not disturb” sign on his hotel door, and whether hotel staff saw something suspicious in his room but failed to report it.\\nThough authorities have described the investigation as a team effort, they have not explained what role Las Vegas police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are playing in the case.\\nArticle posted with

       " {'text': 'The US Is Blatantly Telling Lies\\n\\nIt’s no secret that the Trump administration has a strong distaste for Iran.\\nIran is one of the only issues on which the U.S. president has remained relatively consistent.\\nTrump berated the country both before and after taking office.\\nHowever, Trump’s anti-Iran strategy goes against the better judgment of even the most anti-Iranian advisors in his staff who don’t want to see the U.S. isolated on the world stage.\\nFortunately for Trump, however, he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize Iran at all costs.\\nOn December 12, Trump’s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, gave a grandiose speech demonizing Iran that echoed Colin Powell’s infamous performance before the U.N. in 2003.\\nHaley’s essential claim was that Saudi Arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to Yemen by the Iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on.\\n“If we do nothing about the missiles fired at Saudi Arabia, we will not be able to stop the violence,” Haley warned.\\n“There is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on Saudi Arabia come from Iran,” she said.\\n“The evidence is undeniable.\\nThe weapons might as well have had ‘Made in Iran’ stickers all over it.”\\nBuy Gold at Discounted Prices\\nHowever, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech.\\nAs Common Dream’s Reza Marashi explained:\\n“Haley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis.\\nOf course, the UN has reached no such conclusion.\\nInstead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have ‘no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.’ Asked about Haley’s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden’s ambassador to the UN said, ‘The info I have is less clear.’ Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley’s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles’ origin.\\nPerhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company.\\nDid she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report?\\nThe world may never know.”\\nRegardless of the fact that Haley misrepresented the U.N. report in question, it appears the entire premise of the U.N. report is almost completely incorrect, anyway, according to former inspector Scott Ritter.\\nRitter writes:\\n“The missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.\\nThe modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.\\nThe UN panel claims not to have any evidence of ‘external missile specialists’ working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.” [emphasis added]\\nSo where did the missiles come from, and who made them?\\nAccording to Ritter:\\n“Rather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.\\nThe transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.\\nThis is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)\\nThe difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.\\nThe increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.\\nThe Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead\/guidance section with the main airframe.”\\n\\ufeff\\nThose who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen’s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.\\nIn January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:\\n“The panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.” [emphasis added]\\nEven if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley’s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn’t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington’s schizophrenic approach to the region.\\nWhy is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?\\nThe issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.\\nAccording to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi’s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.\\nRitter explains further:\\n“If a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?\\nThe fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.\\nIf the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.\\nNo amount of chest-thumping and empty rhetoric by American political and\/or military leaders can offset this harsh reality.\\nThis is the critical lesson of Yemen, and the United States would do well to heed it before it tries to foment a crisis based upon trumped-up charges.” [emphasis added]\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case\\n\\nHey, remember five minutes ago when Pope Francis shouted at a reporter in Chile that there was “no evidence” supporting complaints against his good friend Bishop Juan Barros?\\nAnd, just for good measure he accused the people accusing him – victims of sexual abuse by Barros’ mentor, the convicted sex-predator Karadima – of committing “calumny”?\\n[1] And remember when Cardinal O’Malley told the pope off in public over the “pain” these accusations had caused the victims of sexual abuse?\\nAnd then remember how the pope had apologised-except-not-really because the accusations are, after all, still lies, and that there’s still “no evidence” against Barros…?\\nThe press, secular as well as Catholic, is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros’ complicity in Karadima’s sexual abuse – not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant.\\nNicole Winfield and the Associated Press dropped the bomb that the information came directly from the victims, whom Francis had dismissed and refused to meet with on his trip, and delivered through his own Commission on sexual abuse:\\nPope Francis received a victim’s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it, contradicting the pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover-up, the letter’s author and members of Francis’ own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press.\\n\\nThe fact that Francis received the eight-page letter, obtained by the AP, challenges his insistence that he has “zero tolerance” for sex abuse and cover-ups.\\nIt also calls into question his stated empathy with abuse survivors, compounding the most serious crisis of his five-year papacy.\\nNow it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop.\\nThe Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims, but that the CDF, under Muller, “had already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties.”\\n“But with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops, the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to…Osorno.”\\nThe article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims, it is the same testimony of the same victim-witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros.\\nThe accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros, who the victims said was in the room watching at the time.\\nWhile the specifics are still not known, readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF, whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse.\\nThe website One Peter Five reports, via Marco Tosatti, that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then-cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller.\\nWhen, after several attempts and three months later[2], Muller was able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason, he received the response, “I am the pope, I do not need to give reasons for any of my decisions.\\nI have decided that they have to leave and they have to leave.”\\nMarco Tosatti reports the CDF incident, but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments.\\nWithout naming names, (or, frustratingly, giving dates[3]) Tosatti relates:\\n“It was some time ago to make a bishop, not in Italy.\\nThe nuncio has prepared the triad [the “terna” or list of three candidates].\\nA cardinal, head of the dicastery, perhaps the same holder of the Congregation for Bishops, during the ordinary assembly took the floor, saying: ‘The first candidate indicated is excellent, the second is good.\\nBut I would like to warn of the third, whom I know well, since he was a seminarian, and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality.\\nHe responds little to the necessary criteria.\\nBut the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal, of the circle currently in power, has flung himself at his colleague, accusing him of impropriety.’ The meeting ended without further decisions.”\\nWhatever the details of these strange incidents, what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference.\\nBergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that.\\nEven while “apologising” the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists, saying, “You, in all good will, tell me that there are victims, but I haven’t seen any, because they haven’t come forward.”\\n“In the case of Barros it’s been observed, it’s been studied; there’s no evidence.\\nThe best thing to do if someone believes it’s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence.”\\nThe AP report, however, says exactly the opposite; that members of his own (now defunct[4]) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O’Malley, the pope’s “top abuse advisor,” with the letter to deliver to the pope.\\nMarie Collins, the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned, citing the Vatican’s refusal to take meaningful action, told AP, “When we gave him [O’Malley] the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns.\\nAnd at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.” Juan Carlos Cruz, the Karadima victim whose membership on the Commission the Vatican had blocked, told AP, “Cardinal O’Malley called me after the pope’s visit here in Philadelphia and he told me, among other things, that he had given the letter to the pope – in his hands.”\\nOn the face of it, there are only a few logical possibilities here.\\nIn fact, unless Cardinal O’Malley – who has, as of this writing, remained silent – comes forward and says that he didn’t hand the letter over pope, there is really only one; that the pope lied.\\nAnd this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right.\\nAs Winfield writes,\\n“The revelation could be costly for Francis, whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched Italian abuse case he intervened in became public[5].\\nMore recently, he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year.\\nVatican analysts now openly question whether he ‘gets it,’ and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn’t.”\\n“No evidence…” Lie big, lie often, and when caught, keep lying.\\nOne of the many things these secular reporters seem not to be paying attention to is that “no evidence” is in fact a well-rehearsed, stock response for Bergoglio.\\nHe said almost exactly the same in 2013 when confronted about another predatory homosexual he was sheltering.\\nThe hoopla surrounding the “Who am I to judge” comment tends to obscure the context of the comment.\\nIt was made in response to a question by a journalist about Monsignore Battista Ricca – a prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality is so well known it was covered by the Telegraph as early as July 2013.\\nIlze Scamparini asked the pope about Ricca, saying, “What you intend to do about this?\\nHow are you confronting this issue and how does Your Holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby?”\\nWhat reply did Bergoglio give?\\nHis standard one: “No evidence.”\\nAbout Monsignor Ricca: I did what canon law calls for, that is a preliminary investigation.\\nAnd from this investigation, there was nothing of what had been alleged.\\nWe did not find anything of that.\\nThis is the response.”\\nHe added, “In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.”\\nBut Ricca’s activities, for which the pope claimed there was no evidence, were notorious.\\nThey include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute, and his sexual relationship with a captain in the Swiss army.\\nSo flagrant was Ricca’s behaviour that it took intervention by Uruguay’s nuncio to have him removed.\\nIt was reported in 1999 and 2000 by L’Espresso, who said the information was confirmed by “numerous bishops, priests, religious and laity” in Uruguay[6].\\nIn fact, the evidence shows that Ricca is completely in line with Bergoglio’s normal procedures.\\nAs “Marcantonio Colonna” wrote in the Dictator Pope, “In fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.”\\nIt was at this early “no evidence” comment on the plane home from Rio that some of those paying attention started to understand that Bergoglio’s policy is in line with that of certain leaders of the past who recommended that if a politician was going to lie, he should lie big and lie brazenly.\\nAnd in case anyone was wondering what will happen next, the same advice said to keep on lying after you’re caught.\\nThe pattern of silence and, when pressed, flat-out denial has been Bergoglio’s policy since long before he came on the international scene.\\nHe has a long record in Argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement, and relying heavily on the broad good will of Catholics towards bishops to pull it off.\\nPerhaps his biggest error with Barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the Catholic world as a whole.\\nIndeed, on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people, it could only be measured in the negative numbers.\\n“Argentine Victims Who Tried to Meet with Pope Francis…”\\nThough the website Bishop Accountability is blatantly anti-clerical, their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public.\\nOn their Argentina page is a long list of accusations that Bergoglio\/Francis simply isn’t interested in hearing from victims.\\n“In Pope Francis’s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Wall Street Journal reports, including the years when he headed the Argentine bishops’ conference, he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse.”\\n\\n“All of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later,” the same period when Pope Benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem.\\nThe site says that “in addition to Bergoglio’s failure to respond to victims, the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers.”\\nIn fact, he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese.\\nWeeks after his election to the papacy, he was quoted by his close friend, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, “In my diocese it never happened to me, but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this.” Francis added that he agreed with the “zero tolerance” attitude of the Irish episcopate and admired Pope Benedict’s reforms – most of which he was later to quietly reverse.\\nIt was at exactly this time, however, that victims from Argentina were attempting to get the new pope’s attention.\\nOne, known to the press only as “Gabriel,” wanted to talk to Francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Julio César Grassi, accused of molesting at least five boys, “who has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of Morón and the Court of Cassation.\\nSo far, judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty.”\\nIn case anyone thinks the Grassi-Gabriel case was not serious enough for the pope’s attention, Bishop Accountability summarises, “A year after Gabriel had filed criminal charges [2003] but before the start of Grassi’s trial, three men ransacked the survivor’s apartment and beat him.” These men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case.\\nTen years [after Gabriel filed criminal charges], in May 2013, with Grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009, “Gabriel and his attorney, Juan Pablo Gallego, brought a two-page letter addressed to Pope Francis to the office of the papal nuncio in Buenos Aires.\\nAn employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if Gabriel and Gallego did not leave the premises.”\\nThe group surmises that it was Bergoglio’s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against Grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals.\\nIn 2006, then-Archbishop Bergoglio complained of a “media campaign” and claimed that the Grassi case was “different” from other accusations.\\nDuring his criminal trial Grassi said Bergoglio “never let go” of his hand.\\nIn 2009, Grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of “Gabriel,” who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse, but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in September 2013.\\nSeveral more similar cases, all of whom were rebuffed in their attempts to meet with Bergoglio, are detailed here, for the strong-of-stomach.\\nA virtuoso performance-liar\\nLooking back and carefully examining his record, Jorge Bergoglio’s mastery of using the weaknesses of morally compromised men is becoming evident.\\nIt is arguable that even the members of the so-called “San Gallen Mafia” who apparently conspired to put him on Peter’s throne were used by him.\\nBut he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear; a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters.\\nLooking carefully at the infamous “Who am I to judge” comment, this was clear early on.\\nThe first part of that interview is a blatant and enormous lie, and it was from there that the pope moved on to his apology for homosexuality in general.\\nRecall that this was the very first airplane interview, on the trip back to Rome from World Youth Day in Rio, a matter of weeks after his election.\\nAt the time, the papal apologists sprang instantly into action and we heard all about how the pope was talking strictly within the boundaries of Catholic doctrine.\\nBut perhaps in hindsight, we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech, one that was clearly well-rehearsed.\\n(Don’t forget, no question is asked in a papal interview without being thoroughly vetted ahead of time.\\nJournalists must submit their questions well in advance.)\\nThis was the pope laying out his policy regarding homosexuality, a policy for which he was duly rewarded by being lauded on the cover of the homosexualist lobby’s US trade magazine.\\nRead his full answer carefully:\\nI see that many times in the Church, over and above this case, but including this case, people search for “sins from youth”, for example, and then publish them.\\nThey are not crimes, right?\\nCrimes are something different: the abuse of minors is a crime.\\nNo, sins.\\n\\nBut if a person, whether it be a lay person, a priest or a religious sister, commits a sin and then converts, the Lord forgives, and when the Lord forgives, the Lord forgets and this is very important for our lives.\\nWhen we confess our sins and we truly say, “I have sinned in this”, the Lord forgets, and so we have no right not to forget, because otherwise we would run the risk of the Lord not forgetting our sins.\\nThat is a danger.\\n\\nThis is important: a theology of sin.\\nMany times I think of Saint Peter.\\nHe committed one of the worst sins, that is he denied Christ, and even with this sin they made him Pope.\\nWe have to think a great deal about that.\\n\\nBut, returning to your question more concretely.\\nIn this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.\\nThis is the first question.\\nThen, you spoke about the gay lobby.\\nSo much is written about the gay lobby.\\nI still haven’t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with “gay” on it.\\nThey say there are some there.\\n\\nI believe that when you are dealing with such a person, you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby, because not all lobbies are good.\\nThis one is not good.\\n\\nIf someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him?\\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying ... wait a moment, how does it say it ... it says: “no one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society”.\\nThe problem is not having this tendency, no, we must be brothers and sisters to one another, and there is this one and there is that one.\\nThe problem is in making a lobby of this tendency: a lobby of misers, a lobby of politicians, a lobby of masons, so many lobbies.\\nFor me, this is the greater problem.\\nThank you so much for asking this question.\\nMany thanks.\\nOne of the pope’s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of Begging the Question and conspiracy.\\nHe starts by assuming, without any effort at defence or explanation, a point that concedes the whole issue.\\nThis was the first time a pope had ever used the political term “gay”.\\nNot “homosexual,” not “same-sex attracted,” but “gay,” meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement’s linguistic manipulations.\\nLanguage counts in politics, and a pope using that term means he is by implication starting the discussion – and his pontificate – by aligning himself with the basic tenets of a movement that is violently opposed to Catholic moral teaching, and in direct opposition to his immediate, and still living, predecessor.\\nIn this case too, he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves, or for the most part are the kind of Catholic who believes it is fine to “disagree” with Catholic teaching on sexuality.\\nThere are very few “conservative” Catholics in the Vatican journalist pool.\\nThis means that his use of this language was a conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience, a sly message to say, “People talk all the time about a gay lobby, but you and I both know this is mostly nonsense, propaganda from those people… those conservatives…We cool and hip people don’t hate gays, do we?”\\nThis astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that Ricca has repented and given up his activity, an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up.\\nWe are simply asked to take the pope’s word for it, but given that it follows his astoundingly brazen lie that there was no evidence for Ricca’s homosexual activity in the first place, we can take the assurance for what it seems to be worth.\\nNext, after another little inside nudge-nudge-wink-wink joke about the “gay lobby” – implying (but of course never outright saying) that the whole thing is hysterical nonsense – we hear a direct contradiction to Catholic teaching from no less a source than his predecessor, Pope Benedict Ratzinger.\\n“The problem is not having this tendency.” Well, actually, your holiness, yes it is, particularly in the case of priests.\\nThe “tendency” is called in the same catechism you quote “intrinsically disordered” and Ratzinger was very clear that this “tendency” is a sign of a serious emotional dysfunction that “must” preclude a man from being ordained.\\nSquandering the capital of trust\\nA few months ago in a piece for the Remnant, I talked about why the Church (and nearly all human societies) regard lying as a sin:\\nA mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality.\\nBut Thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics.\\nLying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality.\\nThomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil, and most unlike God, because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes.\\nHabitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being, one that is by nature an opponent of Truth, ordered against Truth.\\nThis of course means that a person whose “orientation,” as we might say, is towards falsehood, even when he is at any given moment saying something true, is still servicing his lies.\\nHe tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality.\\nIt was not by violence, but by lying and manipulation, by issuing half-truths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not, that Shakespeare’s character Iago earned the title of most evil character in English literature.\\nHuman beings are naturally ordered towards the truth, and we have to work at assuming a lie.\\nThis is why confidence tricksters can be successful, why lying works for getting what you want; people don’t see it coming.\\nThe first natural assumption is trust, at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time.\\nWe therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust.\\nConsidering how much trust the Catholic faithful had in the papacy until about 1965, how much un-earned trust Francis started with just by being elected, this pontificate should be remembered as one of the great confidence scams in history.\\nBelieving Catholics have watched aghast as this pope has habitually trampled on every aspect of Catholic teaching.\\nSandro Magister recently published a piece on his website that listed in dizzying detail the many times, in only the last few months, that pope Francis has falsified with obvious intention, the words of Christ in Scripture and the teaching of the Church.\\nOf course this would be of little interest to secular journalists, who have paid no mind to his habit of rewriting Catholicism, but the sex abuse crisis is something secular journalists are very interested in, a fact Bergoglio seems not to have understood.\\nIt is now irrefutable that Pope Bergoglio is a habitual liar – that in fact truth, like reality, seems to mean nothing to him except as a tool.\\nSociologists talk about the concept of the “high trust society,” one in which citizens believe what they are told by the elites and trust them to govern and protect them adequately.\\nThey warn that the general loss of trust in institutions leads to a general state of chaos, in which laws on the books matter little as citizens turn to their last resort of protecting themselves and their own families.\\nThis is the way societies disintegrate.\\nIt has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the Catholic faithful, and this is true.\\nWith a professional confidence trickster on the papal throne, blatantly using lies and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with Catholic doctrine, how long before that predictable disintegration occurs?\\nAre we seeing it already?\\nAre we seeing it in the declarations of this or that episcopate on Amoris Laetitia and Communion for divorced and civilly remarried Catholics?\\nWith Cardinal Marx and others promoting “blessings” for “same-sex unions” are we going to be seeing an escalation of it?\\nI have seen a veritable chorus of Catholics on social media declaring that if Paul VI is canonised, their loss of faith in the Church as an institution will be complete.\\nI am told from contacts inside the Vatican that after the trip to Chile Bergoglio’s support has completely dried up.\\nHe has no more resources of trust even among the people he has chosen to surround himself with and after the reports of Cardinal Sandri going toe-to-toe with him in a shouting match, it seems that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrums are failing to have the desired effect of terrorising his subordinates into submission.\\nMarie Collins, by no stretch even a “conservative” Catholic, echoed this concern, saying the Barros affair has “definitely undermined credibility, trust, and hope” in Francis.\\n“All I can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope, and I am talking about just ordinary Catholics that I know in my own parish, would find it very difficult now…and cannot understand and cannot believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks,” she told the National Catholic Reporter.\\nIt may seem like a moment to enjoy, seeing the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally cracking, but in reality this situation is potentially very harmful for souls in the long run.\\nThere is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after Bergoglio is gone, but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust.\\nAlready fractured since the collapse of all Catholic institutions after Vatican II and the horrors of the sex abuse crisis, how much will there be to repair of the once-steadfast trust Catholics instinctively had in the Church after this?\\nNotes:\\n[1] “Not one victim has come forward in Chile; show me the proof.\\nThis is slander and calumny.\\nIs that clear?”\\n[2] The book “The Dictator Pope” relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even high-ranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope, whose appointments are now completely controlled by the Secretariat of State.\\nIt is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless Cardinal Parolin approves, which may be the reason Cardinal Zen, in his efforts to warn Francis of the dangers of a Vatican deal with the communist Chinese government had to wait in the rain at a Wednesday general audience.\\n[3] This is common in Italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the Anglo world… and drives the rest of us spare.\\nItalians care about getting a general picture of what’s going on, where Anglo-Saxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details.\\n[4] Though she never blamed the pope, Marie Collins complained that Vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the Commission’s recommendations.\\nThe time limit of the Commission’s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the Commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it.\\n[5] Probably a reference to the Inzoli case in which Francis overturned a previous sentence of a Vatican tribunal after the priest – now laicised – approached some of the pope’s close advisors for help, including Cardinal Coccopalmerio.\\n[6] Not that anyone in Rome was trying very hard.\\nSandro Magister reported after the “Who am I to judge” comment, “Before the appointment, Francis had been shown, as is customary, the personal file on Ricca, in which he had not found anything unseemly.\\nHe had also heard from various personalities of the curia, and none of them had raised objections.”\\n',\n",

       " {'text': \"Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges\\n\\nEditor's Note: This is probably a reason why reporters Laura Loomer and Mike Tokes were barred from entering the presser.\\nThey would have posed real genuine questions of Sheriff Lombardo and forced him to stumble all over himself in answering them.\\nThe words “conspiracy theorists” are being bandied about.\\nAre they for real?\\nA well-coordinated, meticulously planned attack on concertgoers leads to the murder of 58 Americans at a country music festival in Las Vegas, with over 500 injured, and they have no explanation or motive.\\nDo the FBI and law enforcement think people won’t talk about it or speculate as to what happened?\\nAre they for real?\\nFurther, the FBI insists there is no jihad motive, while saying they don’t know his motive.\\nHow can they possibly hold those two contradictory ideas at the same time?\\nThe sheriff, alluding to allegations of a conspiracy between his department, the F.B.I., and MGM — supposedly in an effort to establish a legal case — said, “there is no conspiracy.”\\nWilliam Jacobson explains the latest “revise” by the authorities is the now infamously botched Vegas investigation:\\nOctober 13, 2017, Legal Insurrection\\n\\nPolice and hotel still don’t agree on some details.\\nI realize that in the heat of a shooting, particularly a mass shooting, it may take some time for a precise timeline to develop.\\nBut it didn’t take very long for the Las Vegas police to release a precise timeline.\\nThe initial timeline was that Stephen Paddock’s shooting stopped when, approximately 6 minutes after he started, he was interrupted by a security guard from the Mandalay Bay hotel.\\nPaddock then turned his fire into the hallway, firing some 200 bullets, and after that the shooting stopped as police arrived.\\nThat was Version No.\\n1.\\nSome days later, the Las Vegas police backed away from that timeline, and stated that the security guard actually arrived 6 minutes before Paddock started shooting into the crowd 32 stories below him.\\nThat raised a number of question, including why no one called 911 after what must have been a loud volley of shots in a hotel hallway.\\nThat was Version No.\\n2.\\nBut now that is disputed, in Version No.\\n3.\\nWaPo reports:\\nLas Vegas police said Friday that the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival far below his hotel suite did not shoot a security guard six minutes before that rampage, contradicting a timeline they had offered earlier this week….\\nThe confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, six minutes before the mass shooting began, not during the massacre as they had said.\\nLombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman’s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there, at which point the shooting rampage had ended.\\nMGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said….\\nLombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.\\nThis six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments.\\nPolice said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing.\\nMGM, though, said it was “confident” that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and “was derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.” The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor.\\nOn Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company’s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier “wasn’t inaccurate when I provided it.” Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log.\\nUpon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m.\\nThe guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock “in close proximity to” 10:05 p.m., when the mass shooting began, Lombardo continued.\\nClear, right?\\nNot so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock’s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below?\\nLas Vegas police say they didn’t get to the floor until after the shooting was over.\\nBut MGM Resorts International, the owner of Mandalay Bay, says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began, responding to a report of a security guard being shot.\\nThe discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught….\\n… on Thursday, in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting, MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal: Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and “immediately responded.” MGM said that “Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio.\\nThese Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor.” The statement says MGM believes Paddock began firing out the window of his room within 40 seconds of Campos reporting his shooting, and Lombardo said Friday, “I agree with the statement.” These discrepancies on basic facts are feeding conspiracy theories.\\nAs to Paddock’s motive, still nothing from the investigation.\\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Ex-Navy sailor pardoned by Trump says he\\'s suing Comey and Obama\\n\\nA former Navy sailor who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials, alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law.\\nSpecifically, Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information.\\nHis lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.\\n“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton.\\nHillary is still walking free.\\nTwo guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals.\\nWe want them to correct the wrong.”\\nDaigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.\\nThere is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.\\n“We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,” Daigle said.\\n“We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”\\nWhile campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned.\\nTrump often compared the Obama administration’s handling of Saucier’s case with that of Clinton.\\nSaucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009.\\nHe said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine\\'s propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera.\\nSaucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked.\\nBut he lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton\\'s emails.\\n“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” he said.\\n“They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton.”\\nSaucier, 31, said that the pardon has enabled him to pick up the pieces and rebuild his life with his wife and young daughter.\\nA felony conviction left him scrambling to find work; he finally landed a job collecting garbage.\\nNow, he works on design and engineering projects for an industrial boiler company.\\n“Things are starting to go in the right direction,” Saucier said.\\n“I work with a group of really great people, I get to use my skills set.”\\nBecause of the loss of income during his imprisonment, as well as earning below his potential when he collected garbage, he and his wife Sadie lost their home to foreclosure.\\nDebt collectors called and his cars were repossessed.\\n“With a pardon there’s no magic wand that that gets waved and makes everything right,” he said, “But I try to stay positive and look forward.”\\nHe praises the pardons that Trump has granted, and takes exception at the criticism.\\n“The Obama administration singled out Dinesh for things most people don’t even get charged for,” Saucier said.\\n“President Trump noticed that my career was exemplary and that I didn’t deserve what happened to me.\\nConservative commentator Dinesh D\\'Souza, who was pardoned by Trump last week, had pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud.\\nTrump tweeted Thursday: \"Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D\\'Souza today.\\nHe was treated very unfairly by our government!\"\\nD\\'Souza was sentenced in 2014 to five years of probation after he pleaded guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to a U.S. Senate campaign in the names of others.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

Bob Corker is another summertime soldier calling on colleagues to stand and fight Trump while he retires to Tennessee.\\nIt\\'s no wonder the establishment is viewed with such derision.\\nFlake calls Trump \"dangerous to our democracy.\"\\nBut the real threat Trump represents is to the GOP establishment\\'s control of the party\\'s agenda and the party\\'s destiny.\\nU.S. politics have indeed been coarsened, with Trump playing a lead role.\\nYet, beneath the savagery of the uncivil war in the party lies more than personal insults and personality clashes.\\nThis is a struggle about policy, about the future.\\nAnd Trump is president because he read the party and the country right, while the Bush-McCain Republican establishment had lost touch with both.\\nHow could the Beltway GOP not see that its defining policies — open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism, compulsive military intervention in foreign lands for ideological ends — were alienating its coalition?\\nWhat had a quarter century of Bushite free trade produced?\\nAbout $12 trillion in trade deficits, $4 trillion with China alone, a loss of 55,000 plants and 6 million manufacturing jobs.\\nWe imported goods \"Made in China,\" while exporting our future.\\nU.S. elites made China great again, to where Beijing is now challenging our strategic position and presence in Asia.\\nCould Republicans not see the factories shutting down, or not understand why workers\\' wages had failed to rise for decades?\\nWhat did the democracy crusades \"to end tyranny in our world\" accomplish?\\nThousands of U.S. dead, tens of thousands of wounded, trillions of dollars sunk, and a Mideast awash in blood from Afghanistan to Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen, with millions uprooted and homeless.\\nYet, still, the GOP establishment has not repudiated the mindset that produced this.\\nWith the Cold War over for a quarter of a century, what is the case now for America, $20 trillion in debt, going abroad in search of monsters to destroy?\\nConsider.\\nBush-Obama \"open borders\" brought in tens of millions of Third World peoples, legally and illegally, to rising resistance from Americans forced to bear the economic and social costs.\\nWhat was the GOP establishment\\'s reply to the opposition to amnesty for illegals and calls for a moratorium on legal immigration, to assimilate the tens of millions already here?\\nTo call them nativists and parade their moral superiority.\\nFlake and Corker are being beatified by the Beltway elites, and George W.

Myers, an anti-Israel activist, to head the Center for Jewish History.\\nDuring the Myers controversy, the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a “JVP Academic Advisory Board Member.” But in reality the Center, through AJHS, has an ongoing relationship with JVP.\\nThe Balfour event was not AJHS’ only partnership with JVP.\\nIn December, the AJHS will feature “Rubble Rubble”, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel.\\nFishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council.\\nHis goal is to “normalize Jewish anti-Zionism”.\\nAJHS and JVP members get discounted admission.\\nThe venue is once again the Center for Jewish History.\\nSpecifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH.\\nLeo Forchheimer’s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel.\\nWhat would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?\\nA third AJHS-JVP event featured Efrat Yerday, an anti-Israel activist, accusing Israel of racism.\\nEfrat has claimed that, \"Zionism does not only dispossess Palestinians, but it also dispossesses in a very sophisticated way, non-white Jews.\\nBeing Jewish is highly identified with being white because of Zionism.\"\\nAJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives.\\nBut when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective.\\n“Balfour” and “Rubble Rubble” are to be part of AJHS’ “1917: How One Year Changed the World”.\\nThe exhibition is supposed to cover WWI, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Balfour Declaration.\\nBut the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist.\\nThe exhibition closes with Fishback’s anti-Israel agenda.\\nAnd these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel.\\nJVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events.\\nThe American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro-Israel events.\\nIt’s uninterested in partnering with pro-Israel groups.\\nInstead it’s providing a forum for a BDS hate group.\\nAnd it’s no mystery why.\\nThe AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti-Israel activists.\\nLila Corwin-Berman, the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees, is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council.\\nOpen Hillel seeks to \"open\" the campus group to BDS and other anti-Israel views.\\nBerman has defended the anti-Israel hate group IfNotNow, which employs JVP tactics, and condemned efforts to fight BDS.\\nShe signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel.\\nOther AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro-BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich.\\nWhen we look at what is going on in CJH’s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising.\\nMyers is a symptom of the problem.\\nAs is AJHS’s partnership with JVP.\\nA great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to.\\nUnlike CJH, the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century.\\nIts perversion by the radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left to serve anti-Semitic narratives is tragic.\\nAnd yet it’s inescapable.\\nEven as the Myers scandal continues to simmer, the AJHS partnership with JVP is making the choice painfully clear.\\nThe radical anti-Israel left will not be satisfied with embedding “moderate” opposing voices into Jewish organizations.\\nInstead it seeks to normalize the furthest extremes of anti-Israel hatred.\\nAnd it will not be satisfied with anything less.\\nDuring the Myers controversy, defenders of his appointment, including some figures named here, claimed that it was an issue of apolitical scholarship.\\nIs co-sponsoring events with a hate group that has sponsored talks by a woman who accused Jews of drinking blood also apolitical scholarship?\\nThe anti-Israel leftists at the AJHS are clearly not leaving their politics at home.\\nAnd support for them and for Myers cannot be distinguished from support for their views.\\nNot when JVP is at AJHS.\\nWe all have choices to make.\\nSometimes the choices are murky.\\nOther times they are simple and easy.\\nWhen the American Jewish Historical Society hosts and co-sponsors an event by a BDS hate group attacking the existence of Israel and featuring a speaker who had defended terrorism and anti-Semitism, the choice becomes easy.\\nEither you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.\\nAs the anti-Israel radicalism of the left grows, such choices will become even more obscenely simple.\\nBut they will not be any less difficult.\\nOpposing the anti-Israel left makes many important enemies and wins few friends.\\nThe anti-Israel left has built networks that can blacklist, smear and silence almost anyone in an academic field.\\nSpeaking out against hate is easiest when it’s weakest.\\nIt’s hardest when it’s strongest.\\nWhen we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out.\\nWe don’t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti-Semitism when they saw it and heard it.\\nHistory tells us why so many people are afraid to do the right thing when it counts.\\nIt also tells us how irrelevant history makes them.\\nThere are lessons here for the Center for Jewish History and the American Jewish Historical Society, for those on the inside who see the corruption of their organizations every day and for those on the outside who are worried about speaking up.\\nThere are lessons here for all of us.\\nIf you can’t speak out against the American Jewish Historical Society’s partnership with a hate group linked to a literal blood libels and a speaker who defends Hamas, when will your voice be heard?\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Leaked Doc Reveals White House Planning “Regime Change” In Iran\\n\\nThis report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge\\nIt appears Rudy Giuliani wasn’t lying.\\nJust a few days after the former NYC mayor and latest member of President Trump’s unexpectedly let it slip that “we got a president who is tough, who does not listen to the people who are naysayers, and a president who is committed to regime change [in Iran]”, the Washington Free Beacon has obtained a three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials with drafted plans to spark regime change in Iran, following the US exit from the Obama-era nuclear deal and the re-imposition of tough sanctions aimed at toppling the Iranian regime.\\nThe plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including – who else – National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009, writes the Free Beacon, which obtained a leaked copy of the circulating plans.\\nThe regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton—a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change—entered the White House.\\nIt deemphasizes U.S military intervention, instead focusing on a series of moves to embolden an Iranian population that has increasingly grown angry at the ruling regime for its heavy investments in military adventurism across the region.\\n–Free Beacon\\n“The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,” SSG writes in the paper.\\n“This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months” it further claims as an argument to push a “regime change” policy.\\nFor now – at least – overthrowing the Iran government, with its extensive and close ties to the Kremlin, is not official US policy; SSG president Jim Hanson told the Free Beacon that the Trump administration does not want to engage in direct military intervention in Iran – and is instead focusing on other methods of ridding Iran of its “hardline ruling regime.”\\n“The Trump administration has no desire to roll tanks in an effort to directly topple the Iranian regime,” Hanson said.\\n“But they would be much happier dealing with a post-Mullah government.\\nThat is the most likely path to a nuclear weapons-free and less dangerous Iran.”\\nThat will likely change, however.\\nOne source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change\\n“The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,” said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue.\\n“Prior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.\\nIt’s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo’s job to put this consensus back in place.”\\nThe source tells the Beacon that Bolton is “acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.”\\n“John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior—and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially—until that revolutionary regime is gone,” the source said, adding that “nothing’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.”\\nThat said, Bolton is confident that an Iranian regime change will occur in the next six months:\\nJohn Bolton – We Will Be Celebrating in Tehran Before 2019 >You can’t say you weren’t warned pic.twitter.com\/F1dvZAVQaF — Battle Beagle 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 (@HarmlessYardDog) May 7, 2018\\nA second source tells The Beacon that the Trump administration recognizes that the “chief impediment to the region is Iran’s tyrannical regime.”\\n“The problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it’s the Iranian regime,” said the source.\\n“Team Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem.\\nPresident Trump hired him knowing all of that.\\nThe administration will now start aggressively moving to deal with the root cause of chaos and violence in the region in a clear-eyed way.”\\nRegional sources who have spoken to SSG “tell us that Iranian social media is more outraged about internal oppression, such as the recent restrictions on Telegram, than about supporting or opposing the nuclear program.\\nIranian regime oppression of its ethnic and religious minorities has created the conditions for an effective campaign designed to splinter the Iranian state into component parts,” the group states.\\n–Free Beacon\\n“More than one third of Iran’s population is minority groups, many of whom already seek independence,” the paper explains.\\n“U.S.\\nsupport for these independence movements, both overt and covert, could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities.”\\nWithout a regime change, the United States will continue face threats from Iranian forces stationed throughout the region, including in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon.\\n“The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,” the plan states.\\n“Absent a change in government within Iran, America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.”\\nThat said, President Trump made clear earlier in the week that US officials must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime.\\n“Any public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,” according to the plan.\\n“We must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.”\\n',\n",

       " {'text': \"An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University\\n\\n\\u200bDespite suffering several public and humiliating reversals in various forums and venues, those pushing for boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel have not dispensed with their pernicious campaign of hate.\\nThe latest outrage perpetrated by BDS activists occurred at McGill University, where a Jewish student and two non-Jewish students identified as pro-Israel were removed from their positions as directors of the Students Society of McGill University (SSMU).\\nAt the end of his second year, Noah Lew, who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University, applied to serve as Director of the School’s student society.\\nHe was warned by others who had prior dealings with the SSMU, to keep his Jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances.\\nThis is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill.\\nThe toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus.\\nLew followed the advice and was elected as a board member.\\nHis “secret” was intact.\\nBDS provocateurs at McGill had relentlessly tried and failed to pass boycott resolutions against Israel.\\nIn fact, three attempts within an 18-month period were quashed.\\nFinally, in June 2016, SSMU’s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill’s undergraduate student union constitution.\\nThe Board’s ruling, which is called a “reference,” was then referred to SSMU’s directors for ratification.\\nSSMU’s Board of Directors addressed the issue more than a year after the “reference.” Lew and other board members passionately advocated in favor of ratification and their arguments ultimately prevailed over the naysayers.\\nThe malevolent BDS campaign at McGill had belatedly come to an ignominious end; or so we thought.\\nLew and two other directors identified as either Jewish or pro-Israel became instant targets of a campaign of hate laced with blatant anti-Semitic overtones.\\nCampus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so-called “Democratize SSMU” movement.\\nBut Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic.\\nIts raison d'être was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU’s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda.\\nAs an aside, one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov, who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against “Zionists.” As a result, he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill’s Arts Undergraduate Society.\\nSadikov made light of his “punch a Zionist” tweet calling it a “misguided joke.” It does not appear that Sadikov was subjected to any form of school disciplinary action despite the fact that his call for violence violated McGill’s Code of Conduct.\\nMcGill’s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti-BDS stances.\\nDemocratize SSMU shamefully highlighted Lew’s ethnicity as a reason for his removal.\\nAn enlightened, progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.\\nIn October, SSMU’s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors.\\nAccording to Lew, “historically, the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc, all 12 at a time.” But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol.\\nIn this manner, BDS\/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time.\\nIt was repulsive display leftist-fascist bigotry at its worst.\\nThe bigoted BDS provocateurs applauded as Lew and the other two board members were removed from their posts.\\nBut this time, they may have gone too far.\\nEven by BDS standards, their manifestly anti-Semitic campaign antics were beyond the pale.\\nBDS activists generally avoid reference to “Jews” by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute “Zionists” for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions.\\nBut in the instant case, McGill’s BDS campaigners dispensed with their traditional charade and overtly launched their attack against Jews.\\nThe vitriolic BDS campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter.\\nEven SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members.\\nOne can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation, which leads to disciplinary action.\\nJudging by past “investigations” conducted by other schools – SFSU, CUNY and UCI, to name a few – I am not optimistic.\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Kavanaugh and Last-Minute Accusations\\n\\nDemocrats are pulling out all the stops and enabling salacious last-minute accusations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh in order to sink his candidacy.\\nNow that Christine Blasey Ford has finally agreed to testify this Thursday at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding her charge that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a long-ago high school party, these new charges have suddenly emerged from left field.\\nOn Sunday, a former classmate from Judge Kavanaugh\\'s time at Yale accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing himself to her at a party.\\nThe New Yorker has just published an article written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, based on information that was reportedly sent to at least four Democratic senators.\\nThe article recounted a claim by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh’s, concerning “a dormitory party gone awry.” As the article acknowledged, however, “her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.” The article goes on to say that in her initial conversations with The New Yorker, Ms. Ramirez was “reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh’s role in the alleged incident with certainty.” It was only after “six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney” that Ms. Ramirez was suddenly able to pinpoint Judge Kavanaugh as having committed an unsavory act, even though she admitted being “foggy” at the time.\\nThe New Yorker article also noted that the magazine “has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.”\\nMeanwhile, the ever-present Michael Avenatti, attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he had information from anonymous sources that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend had \"targeted\" women with drugs and alcohol at parties to facilitate \"gang rape.\"\\nHaters of Judge Kavanaugh are turning the process of Senate confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee into something worse than a travesty.\\nHis opponents in the Senate have transformed their “advise and consent” function into a campaign of no-holds barred character assassination.\\n\\nWhile Judge Kavanaugh weathers these latest accusations, which he adamantly denies, his real test will be on Thursday, assuming that Christine Blasey Ford will follow through on her agreement to testify at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\\nHer attorneys stalled for a week before making the announcement that Ms. Ford would testify despite certain “unresolved” issues.\\nAmong the issues Ms. Ford’s attorneys have raised was the refusal of the committee to subpoena one of the purported witnesses, Mark Judge, who Ms. Ford reportedly claims was involved in the alleged incident, as well as “who on the Majority side will be asking the questions, whether senators or staff attorneys.\"\\nA week has already gone by since Ms. Ford went public with her story in an interview with the Washington Post while Ms. Ford and her attorneys stalled for time.\\nThey raised one procedural issue after another while claiming that the committee majority was “bullying” Ms. Ford.\\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-I) has bent over backwards to accommodate Ms. Ford’s preferred scheduling for her appearance.\\nHe extended the deadline several times for her to come to a decision on whether to testify at all.\\nHe had offered various options for her to testify publicly or privately or to be interviewed by committee staff in her home state of California, whichever setting would make her more comfortable.\\nHowever, in Senator Grassley’s e-mail thanking Ms. Ford for finally agreeing to a time certain for her testimony, Senator Grassley correctly reminded her attorneys that “the committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, and what order to call them and who will question them.\\nThese are nonnegotiable.”\\nWhile the negotiations with Ms. Ford’s attorneys for her testimony were underway, Democrats were sitting on the latest allegations, ready to pounce as soon as Ms. Ford’s accusation was about to be heard.\\nSome Democrats are already using the Ramirez episode to push anew for a fresh FBI investigation and to postpone Thursday’s scheduled hearing.\\nIdeally, if the Democrats cannot apply enough pressure to force a withdrawal of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination through their relentless campaign of character assassination, they want to push any Senate votes until after the midterm elections at the earliest.\\nThen they will claim that the newly elected senators should be involved in the confirmation decision.\\nIn the meantime, Judge Kavanaugh’s adversaries in the Senate, the mainstream media and progressive circles continue to bludgeon Judge Kavanaugh in the court of public opinion.\\nAll of their stratagems are an obvious attempt to buy time in order to persuade any wavering senators that Judge Kavanaugh is too tainted by sexual assault charges – whether proven or not - to sit on the Supreme Court.\\nProof does not matter to those wanting to bring Judge Kavanaugh down at any cost.\\nRegarding Ms. Ford’s accusation, they know that the proof so far is non-existent, aside from Ms. Ford’s own assertions contained in her confidential letter given to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, last July, and in her Washington Post interview.\\nWhile a redacted version of Ms. Ford’s letter has been published, Senator Feinstein has refused to date to give even Senator Grassley a copy of the completely unredacted version.\\nThe FBI has already conducted 6 background checks, no federal crime is alleged, and there is no forensic evidence to investigate after 30 years at a site that Ms. Ford cannot even identify.\\nWhat we do know so far tends to undercut the credibility of Ms. Ford’s accusation.\\nMs. Ford cannot corroborate her decades-old charge of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh.\\nWhatever corroboration Ms. Ford was hoping for from “witnesses” she claimed were at the alleged party is non-existent.\\nThe individuals she reportedly named in her unredacted confidential letter given to Senator Feinstein have either denied being at such a party or do not recollect what Ms. Ford has alleged.\\nMoreover, by her own admission to the Washington Post, Ms. Ford “said she does not remember some key details of the incident.” She does not remember, for example, where it happened, how the party came together in the first place, or how she got home after the alleged incident.\\nShe believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, but reportedly could not be more precise on the day or even the month of the party.\\nAfraid that Ms. Ford’s sexual assault allegation could be readily challenged and anxious to establish some sort of pattern of sexual misconduct beyond this single alleged incident, the Kavanaugh haters have latched onto Ms. Ramirez’s story.\\nThe New York Times published an op-ed column last week by a psychiatrist, Richard A. Friedman, who cited neurological science to conclude that Ms. Ford’s claim that she has “a vivid memory of an attack that took place when she was 15” is “credible.” The reason, he wrote, is that “memories formed under the influence of intense emotion — such as the feelings that accompany a sexual assault — are indelible in the way that memories of a routine day are not.” The only problem with Dr. Friedman’s thesis is that Ms. Ford has apparently forgotten such key details surrounding the alleged sexual assault as when and where it happened and how she got home.\\nMoreover, when Ms. Ford finally told someone about the incident in any detail some 30 years later in 2012, during a couples therapy session with her husband, she did not name Judge Kavanaugh specifically, according to the therapist’s notes that Ms. Ford had provided to the Washington Post in connection with her interview.\\nThe Washington Post reported that the therapist’s notes it reviewed “do not mention Kavanaugh’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students ‘from an elitist boys’ school’ who went on to become ‘highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.’”\\nMs. Ramirez’s story is even less credible.\\nIt took an attorney and six days of very belated reflection to help revive her memory of an incident she claimed happened while she herself was very drunk.\\nSenator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), one of Judge Kavanaugh’s fiercest critics who told men to “shut up” regarding Ms. Ford’s allegations, said she doubts Judge Kavanaugh’s credibility because of “how he approaches his cases.” Aside from mischaracterizing the constitutional textualist reasoning underlying Judge Kavanaugh’s opinions, she is saying that she does not believe Judge Kavanaugh’s denial of the sexual misconduct allegations lodged against him because of the opinions he wrote that she does not like.\\nSuch circular “reasoning” would be amusing if it were not so emblematic of what one writer called “Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome.\"\\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is also suffering from the same syndrome.\\nShe said Thursday regarding Ms. Ford: \"I believe her because she is telling the truth and you know it by her story.\"\\nMs. Ford’s supporters are exploiting the “Me Too” movement to declare Judge Kavanaugh guilty simply because Ms. Ford is a woman who has made what they call, without any corroborating evidence to date, a “credible” charge.\\nThe same would presumably be the case for Ms. Ramirez.\\nThey argue that since the Senate Judiciary Committee is not a criminal judicial trial, but rather a legislative hearing for confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee, the normal burden of proof shouldered by the accuser should not apply.\\nJudge Kavanaugh should have to prove that he is not guilty, they are in effect insisting.\\nThis is another case of Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome.\\nLet’s assume for the sake of argument that the normal burden on the prosecution in a criminal case - to prove the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - is not applicable regarding the charge against Judge Kavanaugh since he is not a defendant in a criminal trial.\\nHowever, that should not flip the burden of proof onto Judge Kavanaugh altogether.\\nJudge Kavanaugh is being subjected to charges of a criminal nature that could not only deprive him of a seat on the Supreme Court for which he is otherwise eminently qualified.\\nMs. Ford’s unsubstantiated accusation can completely destroy Judge Kavanaugh’s life by causing irreparable damage to his reputation for integrity and good character and to his career, which he has built up during decades of public service.\\nHis family’s lives have been completely upended.\\nPlacing the burden on Judge Kavanaugh to prove that he was not involved in an uncorroborated incident from years ago, about which even his accuser does not recall key details, turns the fundamental constitutional principle of due process upside down.\\nMs. Ford should have the burden to prove her accusations by at least a preponderance of all the evidence presented.\\nThis charade must come to an end.\\nNo more extensions for Ms. Ford to come forward and testify.\\nIf Ms. Ford does not follow through with her agreement to testify in an open Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday and do so upon the conditions set by the committee, she should go home while the committee proceeds to an immediate vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.\\nIf Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh do testify, the senators deciding on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as well as the American public following the testimony must remember one cardinal rule.\\nIn a nation guided by fairness and law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.\\nSadly, many of Judge Kavanaugh’s haters have thrown that rule aside.\\nIf Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination is pulled as a result of the smears and character assassination, President Trump should immediately nominate someone on his short list such as Amy Coney Barrett and the Senate Republican majority should then push through the new nominee’s confirmation as soon as possible.\\nDelay is not an option.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'San Francisco Show Trial Sequel\\n\\nLast week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14.\\nThe jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession.\\nMany observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse.\\nSan Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate’s gun possession charge dismissed.\\nGonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that “momentary” possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime.\\n“If you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn’t be a crime,” Gonzalez told reporters.\\nThe Steinle family and relatives of murder victims have new cause for outrage, but this gambit is consistent with Gonzalez and the San Francisco show-trial in which he co-starred.\\nGonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship.\\nAs he explained, “I think I was a product of affirmative action,” and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School.\\nIn San Francisco, Gonzalez became known as “The Great Left Hope,” and a hero to Bay Area radicals.\\nThe La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA’s most high-profile Stalinists.\\nIn 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\\nIn 2003, as board president, he commissioned a graffiti artist to spray SMASH THE STATE on his office wall, in “traffic cone orange.” As Gonzalez explained, “This is a sentiment I think all of us have had.\\nYou have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don’t like.”\\nIn 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom.\\nIn 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president.\\n“He has a great, steadfast commitment to justice,” Nader told reporters.\\nOn that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt.\\nIn jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three “immigrants,” quite possibly false-documented illegals.\\nTrue to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors.\\nSo observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted.\\nGarcia told the court Zarate was playing his own “secret version of Russian roulette,” and thus parroted the defense’s contention that the shooting was all a matter of chance.\\nAs it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger.\\nIn a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle.\\nIn another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta.\\nThis happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead.\\nGarcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands.\\nAfter firing, he tossed the gun in the water.\\nHe said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims.\\nEven so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter.\\nAny observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted.\\nUnlike Stalin’s trials of the old Bolsheviks, and Fidel Castro’ trial of General Arnaldo Ochoa, this show trial aimed to establish innocence for the guilty, and the dynamics of the left were on full display.\\nDenunciations of “gun violence” were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak.\\nAs Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love.\\nOn the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society.\\nIn the view of Gonzalez, society is progressing toward a social justice paradise ruled by a wise elite that knows what’s best for all.\\nIn this inexorable progress, determined by history, some people are going to have to die.\\nAs Bertolt Brecht told Sidney Hook about Stalin’s victims, “the more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot.”\\nOut for a summer-day walk with her father and a friend, Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim, gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, part of the sanctuary state of California.\\nAs defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said, the verdict was a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\\nSince Donald Trump mentioned the case, former vice-presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter.\\nThat explains the effort of “The Great Left Hope” to have his client’s felony gun possession conviction tossed.\\nAny observer of the case could believe it probably will be.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': \"Et Tu, Benedict?\\n(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)\\n\\nRecently an editor of a “conservative” Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on.\\nI declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.\\nIt’s been five years, and I’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “courageous” act it was to give up the pontificate.\\nThe consequences of that act have been so outlandish – even for people who are mostly OK with Francis – that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it.\\nEditor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.\\nDario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation.\\nIn no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that “there is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.” Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica.\\nOur thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.\\nMJM\\nIn fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope – a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the “filth” in the Curia and throughout the church – suddenly just decide to quit?\\nWhy would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?\\nAt the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty.\\nThese absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did.\\nWe cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.\\nCould we have been wrong about him?\\nAnd if so, could we have been this wrong?\\nFor reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, “I’m tired.” There was some implication that he didn’t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn’t make it to World Youth Day and similar events.\\nThe trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself.\\nOf all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.\\nAnd since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him?\\nThis man whom we had believed a “champion of orthodoxy,” whom we thought we knew.\\nError, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is.\\nHow content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.\\nAfter three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: “Your goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.” Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn’t lie:\\nSo strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.\\nBut this is not what we see.\\nThere he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.\\n“Perhaps it was written for him.” Well, why repeat it then?\\nWhy, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?\\nIf it is a deception, why participate in it?\\nIn fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “miss” him have failed to respect him in one way; they won’t take him at his word.\\nSome insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn’t valid.\\nBut we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.\\nAnd indeed, far from being an isolated “prisoner of the Vatican,” Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism.\\nWe have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.\\nThere’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn’t add up, it’s true.\\nAll the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses:\\nWhy did you resign?\\nRatzinger: “I was a bit tired and didn’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.”\\nIf you’re not pope, why do you still wear the white?\\nRatzinger: “Oh, there wasn’t a black cassock that fit me.”\\nWhy do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?\\nRatzinger: “Well, I’m an ‘emeritus,’ you see…”\\nAnd where did this “emeritus” business come from?\\nDoes it have any precedent in Catholic history?\\nWhat does it mean canonically and doctrinally?\\nRatzinger: “…”\\nWhat was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided “munus” – with an active member and a “contemplative member”?\\nDoesn’t that just mean there are two popes now?\\nRatzinger: “…”\\nAnd perhaps most agonising of all: “How can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?”\\nA few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist\/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.\\nSteve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud:\\nFive years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.\\nAnd through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.\\nYou may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.\\nHe walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment.\\nAnd still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he’s the only one who won’t be canonized.\\nWho is the real Joseph Ratzinger?\\nI have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, “Maybe it’s really just that he wasn’t who we thought he was.” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.\\nI think we made the mistake of believing the press.\\nWe were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him.\\nWe failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.\\nWhat the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a “progressive,” as the term was understood in 1962.\\nThis reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.\\nFrings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “conservatism” in the “schema,” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions.\\nAfter this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned.\\nThis was done, over Ottaviani’s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French “progressives” who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started.\\nIt has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger – the maverick “progressive” academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary – who wrote that speech.\\nCardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:\\n“Joseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.\\nFrings, Archbishop of Cologne.\\nBlind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.\\nNow then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.\\nDespite a reply by Card.\\nOttaviani, Frings sustained his critique.\\n\\n“It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.\\n\\n“Card.\\nSeper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation.\\nRatzinger, who did not change, continues it.”\\nRatzinger’s reputation as a “progressive” is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work.\\nIt went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church “never to return” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.\\nIn his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, “Should the Council be revoked?” and in response recommended the “razing of the bastions” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:\\nThe duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.\\n\\nThis implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.\\nNeither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.\\nHence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.\\nIt was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.\\nBut to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.\\nHis was the thesis – a mainstay of “conservative” ideology – that the “real” Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.\\nHow ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had “destroyed” and would gain the media-generated reputation as an “arch-conservative”.\\nAnd it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.\\nWith the “arch-conservative” “Rottweiler” Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today?\\nWhat did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism – that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II?\\nWhat did “silencing” by Ratzinger’s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity “priest-theologian,” courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism?\\nKung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?\\nCan we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?\\nPrecious few.\\nBut we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith – academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world – with never a peep of protest from Rome.\\nMoreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the “arch-conservative” John Paul II and the “Rottweiler” Benedict XVI pontificates.\\nWhy did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?\\nIs it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?\\nThe “progressive” destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet “arch-conservative”…\\nIndeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.\\nHe was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “left” after the 1960s while he stayed in place.\\nPerhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.\\nPerhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called “progressive” in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a “champion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy” by 2005.\\nIs this why he resigned?\\nIs it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?\\nPerhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the “liberal” European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the “Sankt Gallen Mafia” that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict.\\nFausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012.\\nMartini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.\\nApparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.\\nBy 2012, this had proved impossible.\\nWhy would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini – the “godfather” of the “liberal wing” of European Catholicism?\\nI think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.\\nThey were esteemed academic colleagues.\\nThey were brothers of the episcopate.\\nThey were members of the club.\\nAny appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.\\nWhy wouldn’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?\\nWhy is Walter Kasper a cardinal?\\nOne of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these “conservative” prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals.\\nIt beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia.\\nWhen, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.\\nJorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the “ultra-liberal” “wing” of the post-Vatican II Church.\\nIn an article on the cardinal’s life’s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.\\nThe monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper’s work as Bergoglio’s.\\nThis is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.\\nJansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another “Sankt Gallen” member.\\nThis was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.\\nBut that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn’t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear?\\nWhy was he not – at the very least – given the same “silencing” treatment as Kung?\\nKasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.\\nBut it’s a simple truth: he’s a heretic.\\nEveryone knows he’s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades.\\nAfter openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and\/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.\\nRemember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger’s CDF in 1993.\\nBut he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.\\nNor was he removed from places of influence.\\nFar from it.\\nIn 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.\\nIn 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the “ecumenical” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.\\nIn 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave.\\nThen Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.\\nAnd, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger’s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave.\\nAs Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,\\nCardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.\\nBut since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.\\n(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)\\nExcuse me Maike, but I don’t think this is a parenthetical issue.\\nIs it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected?\\nCardinal Ratzinger, Pope “Emeritus” Benedict – whatever you want to call yourself – I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal?\\nWhy is he still a bishop?\\nWhy is he still allowed to call himself a “Catholic theologian”?\\nWhy did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be?\\nDoesn’t anyone else want to know this?\\nDon’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?\\nWhy was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?\\nWhy a man like Weakland, the active homosexual who paid off his ex-lover, was not excommunicated?\\nWhat are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?\\nMy own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle’s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami’s Favalora, Rochester’s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool… I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.\\nFor fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done, as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed, year after year to continue attacking the Church.\\nWhy have we so often seen these men – compromised intellectually and morally – elevated to superior rank, despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith?\\nThe end of “Big Umbrella Catholicism”\\nThe New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.\\nMaike Hickson quotes him, writing of this bizarre situation – in which each, of the so-called “Sankt Gallen Mafia” prelates, including Kasper, who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching: “It was characteristic of the church’s effective truce [between conservatives and progressivists] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats, elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach.”\\nWhen journalists talk about Catholicism, they often speak of a man like Kasper being – as his Wikipedia page puts it – “one of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church.” And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics, we’re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times.\\nThere’s a “liberal wing” and a “conservative wing” and they’re both Catholic.\\nSteve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole “emeritus pope” charade was an error: “I think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe, and we shouldn’t have.” In fact, I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post-conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error.\\nBy playing along, by pretending that we could be “conservative Catholics” in this New Paradigm that also includes “liberal Catholics” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.\\nBecause of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church’s leadership since 1965, we have all come to accept the underlying premise; that the Church is a “big umbrella” with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions, that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal “taste” …that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth.\\nThis schizophrenia is the model under which “conservatives” have operated all this time, and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a “conservative champion of orthodoxy.” And what has this achieved?\\nIt created cover for the men of Kasper’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.\\nAnd just like that, the jargon of “tolerance” and the “big umbrella” is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun.\\nAs it had to.\\nThey, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same.\\nAnd their New Church is the only one left.\\nFor five decades we played the Anglican game; as long as we don’t talk about it, there isn’t a problem.\\nOttaviani’s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church – and as de Lubac said above, it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger.\\nWe had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.\\nOne of the things I’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla\/Ratzinger era.\\nWe were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the “New Springtime of Vatican II,” while we watched these wolves in shepherds’ clothing eating the sheep.\\nNow we can, at least, finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the New Paradigm of Merciful Conciliar Wonderfulness.\\nFor those still wondering, Bergoglio isn’t a shock, he isn’t even a surprise; he’s just the logical end result.\\nThis pontificate isn’t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.\\n\",\n",

Jackie Speier (D-CA) told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily on Tuesday that the U.S. House of Representatives has paid $15 million to alleged victims of sexual harassment by its own members in recent years.\\n“We do know there is about $15 million that has been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last ten to 15 years,” she said.\\n“15 million dollars has been paid out over sexual harassment claims,” Todd replied, somewhat shocked.\\n“So, obviously more than one member of Congress.”\\nIf members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don’t the American people know about it?\\nAnd why are those members of Congress still allowed to serve?\\nRepresentative Barbara Comstock also testified on Tuesday.\\nShe said that one current member of Congress exposed his private parts to a female staffer when she delivered papers to his house…\\nRep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said at a House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday that a sitting member of the U.S. Congress exposed himself to a young female staffer who delivered papers to his house–at his request.\\nWe need to be told who this member of Congress is so that he can be removed from Congress immediately.\\nThis kind of behavior is not acceptable for anyone in a civilized society – and that goes double for someone that is supposed to be one of the leaders of our nation.\\nHere are the exact words that Comstock used as she described this incident…\\nThis member asked a staffer to bring them over some materials, to their residence.\\nAnd the young staffer — it was a young woman — went there and was greeted with a member in a towel.\\nIt was a male, who then invited her in.\\nAnd at that point, he decided to expose himself.\\nShe left, and then she quit her job.\\nShe left, she found another job.\\nOf course, this sort of behavior is not just limited to members of Congress.\\nAccording to an ex-Secret Service agent, Vice-President Joe Biden was regularly engaged in “Weinstein-level” predatory behavior…\\nAn ex-Secret Service agent is claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden engaged in “Weinstein-level” sexual assault and that he would walk around the VP residence late at night completely naked.\\nAccording to Big League Politics’ Cassandra Fairbanks, a Secret Service agent who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed that Biden “would mess with every single woman or teen,” and that a Christmas get-together at the VP’s house had to be canceled “because Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriend’s asses.”\\nIn fact, things were so bad that at one point a Secret Service agent almost got into a fight with Biden.\\nHere is more from Paul Joseph Watson…\\nDuring one alleged incident in 2009, Biden cupped the breast of a Secret Service agent’s girlfriend during a photo, prompting the agent to shove Biden and almost hit him.\\nThe agent was subsequently suspended for a week, according to the source.\\nMen would often stand in front of female agents and Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just to get them away from Biden, according to the agent.\\nWhen I am elected to Congress, I am going to make fighting this sort of predatory behavior a top priority.\\nWe are supposed to serve as an example to the rest of the world, and instead, we have become a bad joke.\\nThose that have been engaging in this sort of shameful behavior have got to go because we simply are not going to put up with it anymore.\\nArticle posted with permission from End of the American Dream\\nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare.\\n',\n",

Carlos Castillo Armas, who proceeded to instigate a reign of terror across Guatemala.\\nThe Guatemalan operation was brilliant and ingenious.\\nThe CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting “national security” by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro-U.S. military general.\\nTracy Barnes, one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA’s second-highest medal.\\nThe CIA’s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious.\\nThe doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front.\\nAt a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound — the one in the front of Kennedy’s neck — was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front.\\nThis necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated.\\nKeep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence.\\nBut he also went a step further.\\nHe said that he was being framed for the crime.\\nThe obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front?\\nWouldn’t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired?\\nThat’s where the brilliance, ingenuity, and cunningness of the cover-up come into play.\\nIf Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front.\\nWho would those confederates be?\\nThere could be only one answer: communists.\\nSoviet and Cuban communists, to be more specific.\\nHow would we know this?\\nThat’s where Oswald’s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play.\\nRegime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\\nOswald traveled to Mexico City where he purportedly visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies and where he supposedly met with a premier assassin for the Soviet Union.\\nKeep in mind that this was the height of the Cold War between the United States and that the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, had taken place the previous year.\\nSo, President Kennedy has been assassinated.\\nOswald is immediately arrested.\\nHe has confederates firing from the front, who almost certainly are Soviet and Cuban communists, especially since Oswald has supposedly just recently visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City.\\nWhat does all that mean?\\nAn assassination of the president by the Soviet Union and Cuba is obviously an act of war.\\nThat means nuclear war is about to break out because there is no way that the United States is going to sit idly by when the Reds have just assassinated America’s president.\\nExcept for one thing: The communist part and the nuclear-war part were concocted.\\nThat was all part of the plan.\\nThat was the ingenious way that the CIA was able to get the investigation into the assassination squelched just as soon as Oswald was murdered.\\nIn the early days of the Warren Commission, commission chairman Earl Warren called a top-secret meeting of the commission.\\nIts purpose was to discuss information that Warren had received that Oswald was actually a U.S. intelligence agent or an informant for the FBI or both.\\nHow did Warren resolve this troubling issue?\\nHe simply asked the heads of the CIA and FBI whether it was true.\\nThey said no.\\nThat was the end of the matter.\\nThe issue was so sensitive that Warren ordered the members of the commission to never reveal the meeting to the American people.\\nHe ordered all notes and other written references to be destroyed.\\nHe also ordered the court reporter to destroy her notes of the meeting.\\nUnbeknownst to him, the court reporter inadvertently kept a recording of the meeting that ultimately came to light.\\nThis troubling issue arose again yesterday, November 2, in the Washington Post in an article entitled “Tantalizing Mystery of JFK Assassination Files Solved – 23 Years Ago.” In the article, author Ian Shapira points out that among the long-secret CIA records that were recently released was a deposition of former CIA Director Richard Helms taken in 1975 before the President’s Commission on CIA Activities, which stated as follows:\\nBELIN: Well, now, the final area of my interrogation relates to charges that the CIA was in some way conspiratorially involved with the assassination of President Kennedy.\\nDuring the time of the Warren Commission, you were Deputy Director of Plans, is that correct?\\nHELMS: I believe so.\\nBELIN: Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an age[nt.… The CIA, Terrorism, an... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\\nThat’s where the transcript ends according to few secret records of the CIA that were recently released by the National Archives.\\nShapira points out, “Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, seized on the truncated file as an example of the government’s continued secrecy about the assassination.” Shapira points out that Helms’ full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994.\\n(The year 1994 was during the tenure of the Assassination Records Review Board, the agency charged with securing the mandated release of JFK assassination records from the CIA and other federal agencies.\\nThe ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone’s movie JFK, which posited that the JFK assassination was a U.S. regime-change operation, no different in principle from the one the CIA had carried out in Guatemala nine years before.)\\nShapira then proceeds to provide the answer that Helms gave, which, as he points out, has been public:\\nHELMS: Mr. Belin, this question, and I think you may recall this, was raised at the time and the Agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever, and we really searched that it had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald.\\nAs far as the FBI was concerned, my recollection is not all that precise.\\nI believe that Mr. Hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either.\\nHe was certainly not an agent of the CIA.\\nHe was certainly never used by the CIA.\\nWhether any CIA officer ever talked to him any place or not I don’t know but I certainly felt quite comfortable — I believe Mr. [John] McCone [a previous CIA director] was asked to testify before the Commission on this point.\\nI believe he was asked to testify.\\nIt was a hot item anyway at the time.\\nAnd my recollection is that I informed Mr. McCone that we could find no evidence that Oswald had any connection with the CIA.\\nShapira ends his article by suggesting that commentators should do more complete research, maybe even use Google, before they jump to conclusions.\\nBut Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of.\\nThat’s because he failed to conclude his article with one great big important point about former CIA Director Richard Helms.\\nWhat is that great big important point that Shapira, who, according to his tagline on his article, “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities,” left out of his article?\\nPerjury.\\nHe left out that former CIA Director Richard Helms was a perjurer.\\nA liar.\\nA CIA official who would tell falsehoods, even under oath, whenever he felt that “national security” required it.\\nShapira failed to note that Helms was convicted in a federal district court of lying to Congress under oath about another CIA regime-change operation ten years after the Kennedy assassination in Chile.\\nInteresting enough, in the Chile regime-change operation, the CIA and the Pentagon were telling their counterparts in the Chilean national-security establishment that they had a moral duty to violate their nation’s constitution and violently remove their nation’s democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, from office.\\nThe reason?\\nAllende was reaching out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as Arbenz had done and just as Kennedy had done.\\nJFKu2019s War with the... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing.\\nThus, given that Helms was an admitted perjurer and convicted liar, what value does his denial that Oswald was an intelligence agent have?\\nIt has no value at all.\\nAnd Shapira, who “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities” had an ethical duty to point out Helms’ proclivity for lying in his article.\\nThe circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly establishes that Oswald was working for U.S. intelligence.\\nHow often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist?\\nIf Oswald was a genuine communist, why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s, given that the Marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the Korean War?\\nWhy would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered, on a moment’s notice, to return to Korea or be sent to Vietnam, Laos, China, the Soviet Union, or Europe to kill communists?\\nDon’t forget: this is the height of the Cold War!\\nAfter Oswald supposedly tried to “defect” to the Soviet Union and promised to give the Russians all the secrets he learned about in the military, why would U.S. officials agree to let him back in the country, and with a communist wife?\\nWhy wouldn’t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the Russians?\\nWhy wouldn’t they harass, abuse, humiliate, persecute, or prosecute him, like they did to Martin Luther King, Dalton Trumbo, John Walker Lindh, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and other people they have deemed to be communists or traitors?\\nHow is it possible that Oswald could learn fluent Russian while serving in the U.S. military without having U.S. military tutors teaching him?\\nHow is it possible that a veteran who embarrasses the U.S. Marine Corps by openly proselytizing for communism in New Orleans is able to saunter across the Cold War stage of history, not long after the McCarthy hearings, without nary a care in the world?\\nThe answer: Helms lied.\\nThere is no reasonable doubt that Oswald was a U.S. intelligence agent, one who was ordered to travel to Mexico City to set the framework for his frame-up.\\nBut things obviously went dreadfully wrong in Mexico City, which is why the CIA had to shut down that part of the post-assassination investigation.\\nNot surprisingly, the CIA’s Mexico City operations regarding Oswald are among the 98 percent of the records that Trump and the CIA have chosen to continue keeping secret from the American people, on grounds of “national security” of course.\\nThus, when Oswald was claiming that he was being framed, there could be only one entity that he could have been thinking about: the CIA, the agency whose officials, as former Washington Post investigative reporter Jefferson Morley has documented, were secretly monitoring his activities in the weeks leading up to the assassination, no doubt to ensure that Oswald had not figured out what was about to happen to him.\\nWe can assume that any frame-up by the CIA is going to be good.\\nThe operation is going to be carefully planned and executed.\\nBut no plan is perfect.\\nThings are inevitably going to go wrong.\\nThe pieces aren’t going to fit together perfectly.\\nThe Mexico City operation is a good example of that.\\nThat’s why the CIA has to continue keeping those records secret.\\nBut here’s another example, a small but important one: Recall that Oswald supposedly hid the rifle before he headed down the steps from the sixth floor of the school book depository.\\nAsk yourself: If someone has just assassinated the president of the United States, is he really going to take the time to hide the rifle?\\nWhat good would that do?\\nWouldn’t officials conduct a thorough search of the area?\\nWouldn’t an assassin instead simply leave the rifle there and get out of there as soon as he could?\\nThen why the hidden rifle?\\nBecause it’s consistent with a frame-up.\\nThe framers had to hide the rifle in advance in a place where no one CIA & JFK: The Secret ... Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing.\\nwould see it during the morning of the assassination, which took place after noon.\\nNo matter how good a frame-up was, the CIA knew that it could be detected with an aggressive investigation.\\nThat’s where ingenuity and cunning come into play.\\nThey had to figure out a way to shut down the investigation so that the frame-up would remain intact.\\nThat’s why they had shots fired from the front and placed Oswald in the rear.\\nThe idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald’s supposed communist confederates in the front, which in turn would lead to nuclear war, the investigation had to be shut down immediately, especially since it was the CIA itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting, in partnership with the Mafia, to assassinate Castro.\\nIt was one of the most brilliant and cunning ruses in history.\\nThey get the body out of Parkland by force, in violation of Texas law, and put it in the hands of the military in Maryland, which conducts a secret fraudulent and bogus autopsy.\\n(See my book The Kennedy Autopsy.)\\nLyndon Johnson telephones Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade on the night of the assassination and orders him to shut down any investigation of a conspiracy because it might lead to nuclear war.\\nAs soon as Oswald is assassinated, the FBI orders Wade to turn over all his investigative files to the FBI.\\nAt the same time, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and FBI Head J. Edgar Hoover both write secret memos and reports saying any further investigation must stop immediately.\\nLyndon Johnson gets Earl Warren and Sen. Richard Russel to join the Warren Commission by telling them that the assassination could lead to World War III.\\nJohnson appoints former CIA Director Allan Dulles, who Kennedy had fired as a result of the CIA’s regime-change operation at the Bay of Pigs, to the Warren Commission, thereby guaranteeing that there will be no investigation of the CIA.\\nThen keep all the records secret for decades, when many people won’t care anymore who killed President Kennedy.\\nAnd employ Operation Mockingbird-like journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative “conspiracy theories” to confound and confuse the public.\\nAnd smear anyone who questions the official narrative as a “communist sympathizer” or a “conspiracy theorist.”\\nThe CIA’s cunning cover-up in the JFK assassination worked brilliantly.\\nThanks to President Trump and the CIA’s decision to continue keeping 98 percent of the CIA’s decades-long secret records secret from the American people, the CIA’s cunning cover-up of the JFK assassination continues to work brilliantly today.\\nReprinted with permission from The Future of Freedom Foundation.\\nThe Best of Jacob G.

       " {'text': 'Uranium One Informant Breaks Silence: Moscow Paid Millions To Influence Hillary Clinton\\n\\nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\\n-Article 2, Section 4 of the US Constitution\\nRight off the bat, this appears to be clear bribery, and a case could be made for treason.\\nHowever, it is now being reported that an FBI informant that was involved in the Uranium One deal, has told congressional committees that Moscow paid lobbyists to influence then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by helping former President Bill Clinton’s charities during the Obama administration.\\nThe Hill\\'s John Solomon reported on Wednesday:\\nThe informant, Douglas Campbell, said in the statement obtained by The Hill that he was told by Russian nuclear executives that Moscow had hired the American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the Obama administration, and more specifically Hillary Clinton.\\n... Campbell added in the testimony that Russian nuclear officials “told me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clintons\\' Global Initiative.\"\\n“The contract called for four payments of $750,000 over twelve months.\\nAPCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement.\"\\nAPCO officials told The Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative and its work with Russia were not connected in any way, and in fact involved different divisions of the firm.\\nThey added their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but rather focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States.\\nIn case you are unfamiliar with Uranium One, it is a Canadian mining company whose sale to a Russian firm was approved in 2010.\\nThe sale gave the Russians control of part of the US uranium supply, thus why I reference a case could be made for treason.\\nWhile Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell\\'s credibility, Campbell\\'s attorney Victoria Toensing told Sean Hannity, “[The Russians] were so confident that they told Mr. Campbell with the Clinton’s help, it was a shoo-in to get CFIUS [The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] approval.\\nThey were so confident in that that they even had him open up the new office because they were planning on the kind of business they were going to do as soon as CFIUS approved it.”\\nIn a lengthy report by Award-winning National Security\/War Correspondent Sara Carter, she pointed out that following:\\nOn Wednesday, he shared with the committee information he provided to the FBI and has in the past described his frustration with the Obama administration’s failure to stop Russia’s nuclear giant from purchasing 20 percent of American uranium mining assets.\\nCampbell testified before numerous Congressional investigators that his extensive counterintelligence work on Russia and stated that during his time as an informant, he obtained information that Russia was continuing to aid the Iranian government.\\nAccording to Campbell Russia provided the resources necessary for the nation’s nuclear reactors, despite promises that they were not sharing such technology with Iran.\\nIn an April 16, 2010, summary brief provided to his former FBI handlers and obtained by this reporter, he stressed his deep concerns about Tenex, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear arm Rosatom and its ongoing work to provide Iran with the technology needed for its nuclear reactor program.\\nAt the time, Rosatom was seeking the approval to purchase the Canadian mining company Uranium One.\\n“TENEX continues to supply Iran with fuel through their Russian company TVEL,” stated Campbell in a 2010 brief provided to the FBI.\\nTVEL is a Russian nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Moscow.\\n“They (TVEL) continue to assist with construction consult and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor.\\nFabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult of TVEL.” Campbell informed the FBI of the close relationship between TVEL and TENEX, both a part of the Rosatom group.\\nHe stated in his brief that while spending time with the Russian executives from both Rosatom and Tenex, that any mention of “TVEL is a subject that is serious to all when mentioned.\\nI do not even raise the subject of TVEL to our friends, but occasionally they speak of it and always in a guarded manner.” In the briefs, he informed the FBI that “occasionally someone will mention having been in Iran but usually it is long after the fact.” And when he asked the Russians about these connections, he stated that they “occasionally speak of the relationship, i.e.\\nequipment, consulting.\\nI asked Vadim (Mikerin) if they felt there was a serious problem, and would they adhere to sanctions and western opinion.\\nHis response was a smile and shoulder shrug.” But Campbell had provided the FBI with evidence of the criminal network and delivered the information to the FBI, which was monitoring his work as an informant and approving his transfer of bribery money to the Russians.\\nThose transfers, which were made in bulk $50,000 sums and at times delivered in cash, occurred between senior executives of the American transportation company and the Russian executives connected to Rosatom.\\nHe had given the FBI irrefutable evidence showing how contracts obtained from the same Russian energy company Tenex, were based on contract bribery and other nefarious actions, he said.\\nSenior members of the FBI, Department of Treasury, Department of Energy and Department of Justice were also briefed on Campbell’s information and were apprised of the various facets pertaining to Russia’s acquisition of the Canadian company.\\nIn fact, Campbell had been told by his FBI handlers that his work had made it at least twice into President Obama’s classified presidential daily briefings.\\nOf course, we know what Obama did with his daily briefings.\\nThey are somewhere in the White House sewer system.\\nCampbell\\'s work has resulted in real justice being administered.\\nIn January, I reported:\\nOn Friday, the Justice Department unsealed an 11-count indictment concerning the Uranium One scandal.\\nSadly, it did not include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but rather former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive Mark Lambert of Mount Airy, Maryland.\\nLambert, 54, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.\\nThe charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.\\nAccording to the DOJ: According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.\\nIn order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland.\\nLambert and others also allegedly used code words like “lucky figures,” “LF,” “lucky numbers,” and “cake” to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.\\nThe indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A’s services.\\nIn June 2015, Lambert’s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA.\\nMikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing.\\nThe indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.\\nWe also know the following about Campbell:\\nUndercover FBI informant William Campbell has given written testimony to Congressional investigators after an \"iron clad\" gag order was lifted in October\\nCampbell was a highly valued CIA and FBI asset deeply embedded in the Russian nuclear industry while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI\\nwhile Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money - which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian \"nuclear money laundering apparatus \"\\n\" He collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period, some of which detail efforts by Moscow to route money to the Clinton Foundation\\nCampbell claims to have video evidence of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.\\nof bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.\\nThe Obama FBI knew about the bribery scheme, yet the administration still approved the Uranium One deal.\\nTo thank him for his service, Campbell was paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a 2016 celebration dinner in Chrystal City\\nWhen it emerged that Campbell had evidence against the Clinton Foundation, a Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff (of FISA warrant application fame) slammed Campbell as a \"disaster\" potential witness\\nAll of this then goes back to things we have pointed out with ranchers in the western united States and how this impacts them, as well as the land grabs that are unconstitutionally orchestrated by the DC government and the Bureau of Land Management.\\nThere is also substantial documentation that was discovered in Oregon that relates to this deal during the Oregon occupation in 2016, which got zero coverage in the mainstream media.\\nAre we about to see a serious shakedown in all of this?\\nTime will tell, but I remain skeptical, as in the end, all we ever get is excuses rather than justice.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Apparently, They Think We are Fools\\n\\nAs Pope Francis continues his five-year-long tirade against the imaginary Catholic Pharisees who defend the Church’s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage and the integrally related Eucharistic discipline—he is still at it as of yesterday (January 9)—he and his collaborators are busily engineering neo-Pharisaical escape hatches from the negative precepts of the divine and natural law emanating from the Sixth Commandment.\\nDetermined to quell any Catholic opposition to his moral subversion, Francis has slapped the label Authentic Magisterium® on his outrageous opinion that in “complex circumstances” wherein it is not “feasible” to live as brother and sister, two people who are not married can be admitted to Holy Communion without ceasing extra-marital sexual relations so long as they engage in an ill-defined “process of discernment.” As Father Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed, this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they “discern” that they should not be receiving Holy Communion because they are embroiled in adultery.\\nDo they think we are fools?\\nThen there is the endlessly double-talking Cardinal Müller.\\nIn a recent interview concerning Rocco Buttiglione’s verbal contortions aimed at demonstrating that the administration of Holy Communion to public adulterers is consistent with the Church’s bimillenial prohibition of precisely that, Müller proposed this preposterous “solution” to a “problem” that does not exist:\\nIt is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience, and with good reasons, of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they cannot offer canonical proof.\\nIn this case the marriage valid before God would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament, certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility.\\nThe Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense.\\nNo Catholic, whether or not he consults a priest, can declare for himself that his marriage in the Church was invalid, especially when—indeed because—he lacks canonical proof of invalidity.\\nMoreover, absent an annulment granted by the competent Church tribunal, a purported “second marriage” can only be an invalid civil ceremony and thus a thinly disguised form of continuous public adultery.\\nCardinal Burke, whom Francis sacked as head of the Church’s highest tribunal because he was a major impediment to the conspiracy culminating in Amoris Laetitia (AL), has observed the obvious in this regard:\\nSuch cases do not exist.\\nNo priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum.\\nMarriage is a public state in the Church, and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the Church.\\nIf a college of judges in a matrimonial tribunal is not able to arrive at moral certitude regarding the nullity of a marriage after a careful and thorough examination of the petition of nullity, how can an individual priest be capable of making such a judgment having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul in question?\\nThe only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live “as brother and sister”, that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person.\\nEven then, the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the Sacraments in a place in which they are not well known, lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the Sacraments.\\nDoes Cardinal Müller think we are fools?\\nSome of us apparently are, or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neo-Pharisaical sophistry that would produce “a discipline alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith.”\\nApparently, they think they can fool us in the next phase of the program of moral subversion that this incredible Pope seriously expects us to believe is an imperative of “mercy”: the justification of contraception in “complex cases” to which “discernment” must be applied.\\nConsider the recent declaration by one of Francis’s new appointments to the Pontifical Academy for Life, whose entire membership he sacked and whose constitution he ordered rewritten to neutralize it.\\nIn a lecture at the Gregorian, one Father Maurizio Chiodi, a “moral theologian” of the post-Vatican II variety, proposed that “an artificial method for the regulation of births could be recognized as anact of responsibilitythat is carried out, not in order to radically reject the gift of a child, but because in those situationsresponsibility calls the couple and the family to other forms of welcome and hospitality.”\\nThat is, Francis’s man at the reconstituted Pontifical Academy declares openly that there is a duty to contracept!\\nChiodi’s sole “authority” for this lie from the pit of hell is nothing more than Chapter 8 of AL, the only document of its kind in the entire history of the Church.\\nAL will doubtless be providing cover for a whole new line of Authentic Magisterium® products, all of which will be utter fakes, including some form of “pastoral integration” of homosexual unions.\\nEvidently, they do think we are fools or willing to play the fool in exchange for the benefits of respectable conformity in the midst of an unparalleled debacle for the Church.\\n(Consider the example of Catholic Answers, which “defends the Faith” while refusing to recognize that it is under ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church.\\nSilence at best is the price it must pay for remaining in good standing with the pro-homosexual bishop Francis has installed in San Diego.)\\nBut we are not fools.\\nAnd God will not be mocked.\\nFrancis and all his designs will ultimately come to nothing.\\nMeanwhile, ours is but to keep the Faith and protest before God and man the blows now raining down against the Church, even when they come from a wayward Roman Pontiff at her summit.\\nIndeed, especially then.\\n',\n",

making the rounds on the Internet, and it has gathered over 2,600 signatures so far.\\n“Most Holy Father,” it begins, “\\u202cMany of us \\u202chave tried to contact you, \\u202con many occasions \\u202cand for several years, \\u202cand we have never received the slightest acknowledgement of our letters or requests for meetings.”\\nThe letter is not from the dubia cardinals, or from the more than 800,000 signers of the 2015 Filial Appeal, or from the signatories of the Filial Correction, but from a group of Islamic converts to Catholicism, who want Francis to answer a simple question: why did they literally risk their lives to become Catholic if Islam is “a good religion in itself” as the pope “seems to teach”?\\nIt’s a question he refuses to answer, despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the Church.\\nThe signers, however, are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer:\\nYou do not like to beat around the bush, and neither do we, so allow us to say frankly that we do not understand your teaching about Islam, as we read in paragraphs 252 and 253 of Evangelii Gaudium, because it does not account for the fact that Islam came AFTER Christ, and so is, and can only be, an Antichrist (see 1 Jn 2.22), and one of the most dangerous because it presents itself as the fulfillment of Revelation (of which Jesus would have been only a prophet).\\nIf Islam is a good religion in itself, as you seem to teach, why did we become Catholic?\\nDo not your words question the soundness of the choice we made at the risk of our lives?\\nIslam prescribes death for apostates (Quran 4.89, 8.7-11), do you know?\\nHow is it possible to compare Islamic violence with so-called Christian violence?\\n“What is the relationship between Christ and Satan?\\nWhat union is there between light and darkness?\\nWhat association between the faithful and the unfaithful?” (2 Cor 6: 14-17)In accordance with His teaching (Lk 14:26), we preferred Him, the Christ, to our own life.\\nAre we not in a good position to talk to you about Islam?\\nThe letter makes short work of the notion that Islam and Christianity can ever be compatible, or that Islam can serve as a path to salvation:\\nIn fact, as long as Islam wants us to be its enemy, we are, and all our protestations of friendship cannot change anything.\\nAs a proper Antichrist, Islam exists only as an enemy of all: “Between us and you there is enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allah alone!” (Qur’an 60.4) For the Qur’an, Christians “are only impurity” (Quran 9.28),” “the worst of Creation” (Qur’an 98.6), all condemned to Hell (Qur’an 4.48), so Allah must exterminate them (Quran 9.30).\\nWe must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5).\\nWhere the Gospel proclaims the good news of Jesus’ death and resurrection for the salvation of all, and the fulfillment of the Covenant initiated with the Hebrews, Allah has nothing to offer but war and murder of the “infidels” in exchange for his paradise: “They fight on the way of Allah, they kill and are killed.” (Quran 9:11) We do not confuse Islam with Muslims, but if for you “dialogue” means the voice of peace, for Islam it’s only another way to make war.\\nAlso, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naiveté in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous.\\nHow can you speak of peace and endorse Islam, as you seem to do: “To wring from our hearts the disease that plagues our lives (…) Let those who are Christians do it with the Bible and those who are Muslims do it with the Quran.\\n“(Rome, January 20, 2014)?\\nThat the Pope seems to propose the Quran as a way of salvation, is that not cause for worry?\\nShould we return to Islam?\\nThe authors say that Islam can be no ally in the battle “against the powers that want to dominate and enslave the world” because “they share the same totalitarian logic based on the rejection of the kingship of Christ (Lk 4.7).” They contest the idea that speaking in an “Islamophilic tone” will help those Christians who are suffering persecution in Muslim countries, professing that “apart from the fact that Jesus has never indicated any other way than that of the Cross, so that we must find our joy therein and not flee with all the damned, we do not doubt that only the proclamation of the Truth brings with it not only salvation, but freedom as well (John 8.32).”\\nThe letter also contrasts the stance of Islamic countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia who “do not welcome any refugee” while Pope Francis preaches\\nthe welcoming of migrants regardless of the fact that they are Muslims, something forbidden by Apostolic command: “If anyone comes to you but refuses this Gospel, do not receive him among you nor greet him.\\nWhoever greets him participates in his evil works.” (2 John 1.10-11); “If anyone preaches to you a different Gospel, let him be accursed!” (Galatians 1.8-9)\\nThe signatories go on to give voice to the utter scandal of the pope’s failure to carry out his evangelical mission as the Vicar of Christ to call home the members of the Islamic faith:\\nThe pro-Islam speech of Your Holiness leads us to deplore the fact that Muslims are not invited to leave Islam, and that many ex-Muslims, such as Magdi Allam, are even leaving the Church, disgusted by her cowardice, wounded by equivocal gestures, confused by the lack of evangelization, scandalized by the praise given to Islam … Thus ignorant souls are misled…\\nTaking the matter further, they warn, too, of the physical danger the pope’s disposition toward Islam invites, saying that it has resulted in Christians\\nnot preparing for a confrontation with Islam, to which St. John Paul II has called them (Ecclesia in Europa, No.\\n57).\\nWe are under the impression that you do not take your brother Bishop Nona Amel, Chaldean-Catholic Archbishop of Mosul in exile, seriously, when he tells us: “Our present sufferings are the prelude to those that you, Europeans and Western Christians, will suffer in the near future.\\nI have lost my diocese.\\nThe headquarters of my archdiocese and my apostolate have been occupied by radical Islamists who want us to convert or die.\\n(…) You are welcoming into your country an ever increasing number of Muslims.\\nYou are in danger as well.\\nYou must make strong and courageous decisions (…).\\nYou think that all men are equal, but Islam does not say that all men are equal.\\n(…) If you do not understand this very quickly, you will become the victims of the enemy that you have invited into your home.” (August 9, 2014) “.\\nThis is a matter of life and death, and any complacency towards Islam is treasonous.\\nWe do not wish the West to continue with Islamization, nor that your actions contribute to it.\\nWhere then would we go to seek refuge?\\nThe signatories plea is that the pope will “quickly convene a synod on the dangers of Islam.”\\n',\n",

Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an “outstanding human being” on Monday.\\nFarrakhan’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people “deserve to die” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “very great man.” “I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told TheDC.\\nThe JTA\\'s awkward attempt to whitewash the newly revealed CBC anti-Semitism included a claim from the ADL that Rep. Davis had been misquoted.\\nAn ADL official told JTA on Friday that the group had reached out to Rep.

own documented bigotry.\\nSofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA).\\nHe has ties to two dozen mosques stretching from Palm Beach County down to Miami-Dade.\\nOn September 21, 2017, Zakkout took to Facebook and posted four David Duke videos.\\nThree of the videos were put out by Duke’s official website, DavidDuke.com, one referring to CNN news anchor Wolf Blitzer as a “Jewish Zionist Agent.” The fourth video was a news report featuring a clip of Duke being interviewed at a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia this past August.\\nAt this same rally, a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of people who were protesting the rally, killing one.\\nThis was not the first time Zakkout has promoted David Duke.\\nIndeed, he has done so for years.\\nIn February 2016, Zakkout publicized on his Facebook page a bizarre Duke report, titled in part ‘Dr.\\nDavid Duke Exposes the Real Racist Jewish Supremacists Who Orchestrate the Destruction of European Mankind…’ Above the posting, Zakkout wrote of Duke, “I respect him for his honesty!”\\nIn October 2015, Zakkout posted to Facebook a Duke video, within which Duke makes the wild claim that there has been a “complete takeover of American foreign policy and… American politics by Jewish extremists.” Above the video on Facebook, Zakkout praised Duke, exclaiming “David Duke, a man to believe in!”\\nIn July 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring another anti-Semitic Duke video on the AMANA website.\\nThe ADL described the video as “venomous.” Currently, AMANA’s official website contains one more Duke video.\\nDavid Duke’s bigoted and inciting material is not the only hate Zakkout promotes.\\nHe also pedals much bigotry coming from others, including himself.\\nIn July 2017, Zakkout posted on his Facebook page a four-minute portion of a speech given by Louis Farrakhan at the Nation of Islam’s February 2017 Saviors’ Day.\\nOn the video, Farrakhan repeatedly refers to Jews as “Satan.” He states to his audience: “Really, they’re not Jews.\\nNo, that’s Satan.\\nYou should learn to call them by their real name, ‘Satan.’ You’re coming face to face with Satan, the Arch Deceiver, the enemy of God, and the enemy of the righteous.”\\nIn June 2016, Zakkout clicked ‘like’ under someone else’s Facebook posting (on Zakkout’s personal Facebook page) of a grotesque cartoon containing a worried-looking religious Jew hiding behind an animated tree with a bearded man brandishing a rifle coming towards them.\\nThe tree is speaking to the man in Arabic, saying “Oh Muslim!\\nOh Muslim!\\nThere is a Jew behind me.\\nCome and kill him.”\\nIn April 2016, Zakkout promoted a report discussing the absurd notion of Jewish involvement in the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\\nA photo from the report shows the burning towers with a Jewish Star affixed to one.\\nThe report begins, “It ain’t debatable!\\nSoup to nuts, top to bottom, the 9\/11\/01 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. were an ‘Israeli’-Jewish job.” The website which published the report and which Zakkout linked to is Mouqawamah Music, a site that openly calls for “Death to Israel” and labels the Jewish religion “wicked and filth-ridden.”\\nIn February 2016, Zakkout circulated on social media a report claiming that “the Holocaust was faked.” It begins: “The alleged ‘Holocaust’ of ‘6 million Jews’ at the hands of Adolf Hitler and National Socialist Germany during WWII is the biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity.” It was produced by The Realist Report, an anti-Jew, anti-black, anti-gay independent media outlet, which describes Hitler as “the greatest leader in modern Western history.”\\nIn December 2015, Zakkout posted a photo of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot, who is a decorated veteran of many different wars and battles fought by Israel over the last three-plus decades.\\nAbove the picture of Eizenkot, Zakkout wrote in Arabic, “You’re a Jew, the grandson of a monkey and a pig.” He signed it “Sofian.” This is one of many times Zakkout has referred to Jews as “monkeys and pigs.”\\nIn July 2014, Zakkout organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami.\\nOn video, Zakkout is shown smiling, as event goers repeatedly shout, “We are Hamas.” After the rally, Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic, above photos from the event: “Thank God, every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel!” He signed it “Br.\\nSofian Zakkout.”\\nSouth Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout’s promotion of bigotry, whether borrowed from others or his own, has been evident for years.\\nYet, there is no outcry from the community, not from Muslims, not from non-Muslims.\\nIt has been virtually ignored by everyone, save this author and his colleague, Director of Militant Islam Monitor Beila Rabinowitz.\\nDespite their having been notified by this author about Zakkout’s perfidious activities, Zakkout remains an active member of the boards of Citizens’ Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County and Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County.\\nThese organizations have provided and continue to provide Zakkout with a facade of respectability.\\nIn reality, he has done nothing to serve the community and only attempts to divide it with his hatemongering.\\nIt is time for Zakkout to be exposed and stripped of his public functions.\\nIf people like David Duke and Louis Farrakhan can be condemned and repudiated for spreading their toxic hate, their fan and propagator Zakkout can and must be as well.\\nBeila Rabinowitz, Director of Militant Islam Monitor, contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence\\n\\nHomeschooling rates are skyrocketing as parents are continually getting more and more upset at the leftist social engineering taking place in public schools.\\nThe indoctrination is getting so bad, that some parents are even concerned about liberal violence against those who reject the brainwashing.\\nAccording to The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Florida, was the last straw for scores of parents.\\nThe paper noted that “the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven’t stopped yet.”\\n“When the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,” said coalition president Tim Lambert.\\n“In the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled.\\nWe’re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.” But according to Natural News, it isn’t just the rampant violence worrying some parents.\\nThat’s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg.\\nChristopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with “the violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.” Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering, which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school.\\nFor example, a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study ‘white privilege’.\\nThe left-wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools.\\nBrian D. Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who’s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents.\\nRay said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.\\nSince teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones, homeschooling takes care of that problem.\\n“Most parents homeschool for more than one reason,” Ray told the paper.\\n“But when we ask families why do they homeschool, near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools, and that includes safety, pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity.\\nIt includes all of that.”\\nIndoctrination means to teach a person to accept a belief uncritically.\\nIt’s the very reason the governments of the world still exist.\\nPeople cannot logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong – even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it.\\nGovernments are nothing more than a handful of people and have no right to aggress against others.\\nBut humans are taught at a young age to never question this and that belief has kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries.\\n\\ufeff\\nIt isn’t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves.\\nAnd as schools continue to fail, and authoritarian policies continue to wreak havoc on our society, more will wake up to the absolute horror of what allowing the state to educate our children has done to the moral fabric of humanity.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Trump\\'s North Korean gamble ends with \\'special bond\\' with Kim\\n\\nNearly five hours of unprecedented and surreal talks between US President Donald Trump and North Korea\\'s Kim Jong Un culminated on Tuesday with fulsome declarations of a new friendship but just vague pledges of nuclear disarmament.\\n\\nFor Trump, that amounted to a triumphant outcome in his extraordinary gamble with the rogue kingdom\\'s despotic leader.\\nBut there were scant details on what new commitments had been secured from Kim, even as Trump announced he would end the regular military exercises the US conducts with South Korea.\\nWhether nuclear disarmament is indeed the final outcome of Tuesday\\'s summit won\\'t be known for years, if not decades.\\nBut the dramatic act of extending his hand to one of America\\'s longtime adversaries will forever illustrate Trump\\'s gut-driven, norm-shattering tenure.\\n\"We both want to do something.\\nWe both are going to do something.\\nAnd we have developed a very special bond,\" Trump said at the conclusion of the landmark summit.\\n\"People are going to be very impressed.\\nPeople are going to be very happy.\"\\nThe document he and Kim signed said the North Korean leader \"reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"\\nIn exchange, Trump agreed to \"provide security guarantees\" to North Korea.\\nBut there was no mentioning the previous US aim of \"complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.\"\\nAnd Kim\\'s commitments did not appear to go beyond what he already pledged to do in April when he met South Korean President Moon Jae-in along their countries\\' border.\\nTrump insisted during a news conference the agreement went further than many people expected.\\nBut he acknowledged the effort to rid North Korea of its nuclear arsenal was in its early stages.\\n\"We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done,\" he said.\\nMore critical, in Trump\\'s telling, was the development of a personal bond with Kim, a brutal dictator responsible for the deaths not only of his own citizens but of at least one American, Otto Warmbier, who was returned to the US in a coma only to die days later.\\n\"I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past,\" Trump said during the summit.\\nLater, during his news conference, Trump said Warmbier\\'s death contributed to the summit taking place.\\n\"Without Otto, this would not have happened,\" Trump said.\\nTrump and Kim -- both intent on making history -- greeted each other early in the day with extended hands in front of a row of US and North Korean flags, a previously unthinkable sight that reflects a new chapter in the two countries\\' acrimonious relationship.\\nTrump\\'s threats to politely walk out of the meeting if his expectations were unmet did not materialize.\\nInstead he predicted he could \"solve a big problem, a big dilemma\" alongside his new partner.\\n\"Working together, we\\'ll get it taken care of,\" Trump said.\\nThe remarks came amid an improbable series of events that few could have anticipated even three months ago.\\nThe unlikely images of US and North Korean counterparts engaging in friendly dialogue lent the day an air of unreality.\\nIn a detailed menu, the White House said the men were served Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream for dessert.\\nOther unforeseen events also surrounded the summit, increasing the drama.\\nMinutes before the historic handshake, Trump tweeted that his top economic adviser Larry Kudlow had suffered a heart attack.\\nImmediately after the encounter, Dennis Rodman -- one of the only Americans to have met Kim -- was openly weeping while being interviewed by CNN\\'s Chris Cuomo.\\nEven Kim seemed to acknowledge the surreality of the day.\\n\"Many people in the world will think of this as a (inaudible) form of fantasy ... from a science fiction movie,\" his translator was overheard saying as the two leaders walked down a white-columned colonnade.\\nAt the conclusion of the summit, Trump hailed the talks as a historic, and personal, achievement.\\n\"We learned a lot about each other and our countries,\" Trump said.\\n\"I learned he\\'s a very talented man.\"\\nWhen pressed about those comments in light of Kim\\'s brutal tactics, Trump continued praising the North Korean leaders\\' ability to run a country at a young age.\\n\"He is very talented,\" Trump said, citing Kim\\'s ability to \"take over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and run it, and run it tough.\"\\nKim assumed power after his father Kim Jong Il, also a brutal dictator, died in 2011.\\nThroughout the day, Trump and Kim\\'s body language was openly friendly, a striking warmth given Kim\\'s iron grip on power and dismal record on human rights.\\nTrump\\'s move to meet him attracted fierce criticism for normalizing a regime routinely called out for its human rights abuses, that over years has built an image of fearsome renegade regime, throwing around threats of nuclear war.\\nThe day began with Trump patting Kim on the back and placing his hand on the North Korean\\'s shoulder as they walked into their first meeting.\\nLater they were seen smiling and laughing over lunch.\\nTrump told reporters he would \"absolutely\" extend an invitation to the White House to Kim, who also heralded a new era.\\n\"Today, we had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind,\" Kim said through a translator.\\n\"The world will see a major change.\"\\nThe meeting came only months after the two men traded nuclear taunts, ratcheting up tensions and leading to fears of war.\\nBy contrast, Trump appeared to back off a military footing on Tuesday, declaring the US will stop the \"war games,\" an apparent reference to joint military exercises with South Korea that North Korea has long rebuked as provocative.\\nTrump also said he hopes to eventually withdraw US forces from South Korea, but said \"that\\'s not part of the equation right now.\"\\n\"I want to get our soldiers out.\\nI want to bring our soldiers back home,\" Trump said.\\n\"But that\\'s not part of the equation right now.\\nI hope it will be eventually.\"\\nTuesday\\'s meeting, convened at a luxury hotel on the island of Sentosa, came just three months after Trump accepted North Korea\\'s invitation for talks on the spot.\\nIt was an extraordinarily compressed timeline for the landmark summit, which at one point was called off entirely as communication broke down between Washington and Pyongyang.\\nThe talks were quickly revived, leading to the highly choreographed event that unfolded Tuesday.\\nAfter the men shook hands, they repaired inside for one-on-one talks.\\nIn that first meeting they were joined only by translators, a break from standard practice of having at least one aide present for high-stakes huddles.\\nLater in the day, advisers joined the talks for a larger bilateral session and a working lunch.\\nTrump took keen interest in the pageantry of the day, insisting the pictures beamed around the world reflect a commanding leader making a decisive, world-altering move.\\nAt the same time, he\\'d admitted he didn\\'t believe he required extensive preparation to take stock of Kim.\\nAs part of the advance work, Trump commissioned a highly produced video meant to convince Kim to relinquish his weapons and open his country to outside investment.\\nTrump showed Kim the movie on an iPad during their talks.\\nHere in futuristic Singapore, however, Kim was able to view the benefits of economic advancement at close range.\\nHe was spotted taking a moonlit stroll around the high-end Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, owned by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, the type of glitzy development few North Koreans could ever imagine coming to their country.\\nKim was cheered by onlookers who caught sight of the dictator, who until earlier this spring was not believed to have ever left North Korea as supreme leader.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': \"THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE\\n\\nOriginally published the Jerusalem Post.\\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.\\n\\nNo, in his speech decertifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn’t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.\\nTrump’s move was not operational.\\nIt was directional.\\n\\nIn his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.\\nFor the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.\\n\\nTrump began his remarks by setting out Iran’s long rap sheet of aggression against America.\\n\\nStarting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran’s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.\\n\\nTrump’s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime’s repression of its own people.\\n\\nBy merging Iran’s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge – or expand the wedge – between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.\\n\\nTrump then turned his attention to Iran’s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.\\n\\nIt is notable that these remarks preceded Trump’s discussion of the nuclear deal – which was the ostensible subject of his speech.\\nBefore Trump discussed Iran’s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.\\n\\nThis was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama’s nuclear pact.\\nBy placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran’s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.\\n\\nAfter accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.\\nOnly then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.\\n\\nBy empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.\\n\\nAfter putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama’s nuclear accord.\\nAmong other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran’s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called “sunset” clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran’s nuclear advancement.\\n\\nTrump’s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.\\nSuch a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump’s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.\\n\\nTrump’s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.\\nHe has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nObama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn’t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama’s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.\\n\\nOver the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker’s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.\\n\\nToday Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump’s agenda.\\nIf he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.\\nAnd he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran’s nuclear program.\\n\\nWhat is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.\\n\\nLeading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama’s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\\n\\nIndeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.\\n\\nThen again, by framing the issue of Iran’s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive – rather than personal – debates on Iran.\\n\\nAnd the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama’s Iran policy – that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program.\\n\\nThe second major risk inherent in Trump’s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.\\nThe problem here is not obvious.\\nClearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.\\n\\nYet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran’s nuclear program.\\nAn improved deal won’t destroy Iran’s centrifuges.\\n\\nIt won’t take away Iran’s enriched uranium.\\nIt won’t destroy Iran’s nuclear installations.\\nAnd it won’t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.\\n\\nSo long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.\\nDistressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.\\n\\nTo understand what must be done we must return to Trump’s speech and its strategic significance.\\n\\nBy taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat – grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime – Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.\\nIf the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.\\n\\nA wider strategy would target Iran’s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.\\nIt would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs’ domestic opponents.\\nIt would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.\\n\\nFriday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.\\nIt is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.\\nIf they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably.\\n\",\n",

Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by “communist aggression.” The resolution served as Johnson’s legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.\\nAs a result, 58,177 Americans would lose their lives.\\nAdditionally, over one million North and South Vietnamese, including 627,000 civilians would be slaughtered.\\nBut it wasn’t true.\\nAt all.\\nIn fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.\\nThe truth of the matter was that the Maddox was engaged in an aggressive intelligence gathering operation working hand in hand in coordinated attacks on North Vietnam by the South Vietnamese navy and the Laotian air force.\\nWhen the government announced that it had been the victim of an unprovoked attack—this was a lie.\\nIn the 2003 documentary The Fog of War , the former United States Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara admitted that the August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack never happened.\\nIn 1995, McNamara met with former Vietnam People’s Army General Võ Nguyên Giáp to ask what happened on August 4, 1964 in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident.\\n“Absolutely nothing”, Giáp replied.\\nGiáp claimed that the attack had been imaginary.\\nIn 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House.\\nBut while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed.\\nTom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam ,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’”\\nIf due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did and over a million lives would’ve been saved.\\nNow, retired military officials—who pay attention to history—are even warning about more staged events to pull us into war.\\n“I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,” Col. Macgregor said.\\n“Many of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf.\\nWe should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump’s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotaged by fake news.”\\nIndeed, as TFTP has reported at length, nearly all wars in US history have been started over false information.\\nTo see a full list of our data, you can click this link.\\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan\\n\\nOne of the biggest stories of 2017 and 2018 is being ignored by the mainstream media and we all know why that is.\\nIt's because it implicates dozens of House Democrats in what could be the biggest crime of spying in US history by Muslim IT spy Imran Awan and his partners.\\nFormer head of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is on the front line of aiding and abetting Awan and his associates as has been revealed by Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller.\\nIn a lengthy report by Rosiak at The Daily Caller News Foundation, he writes:\\ntake our poll - story continues below\\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\\n* Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith

opt out at anytime.\\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\\nEx-Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she intervened in a Pakistani land deal involving her then–IT aide Imran Awan, according to two House employees.\\nThe dispute came after Awan’s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal, and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims, according to a local report.\\nAnd when a House Office of Inspector General cybersecurity investigation found that Awan made “unauthorized access” to House servers, including the House Democratic Caucus’ shortly before the election, Wasserman Schultz became “frantic, not normal,” “making the rounds” to House officials in an attempt to kill the investigation, one House employee told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\\nAwan told people Wasserman Schultz chose the name for his daughter, Leza — a Jewish name — and that the Florida congresswoman’s daughter regularly rode a horse that Awan kept at a boarding facility, sources with knowledge of the relationship told TheDCNF.\\nWasserman Schultz cornered House Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko and called him a “fucking Islamophobe,” saying “you will not so much as take away their parking spots,” the two House employees said Kiko told them.\\nThe congresswoman also told Kiko she had invited Awan’s whole family to her daughter’s bat mitzvah and said she had “helped him with a land deal,” the sources said.\\nA spokesman for Kiko declined to comment on this story.\\nA 2009 article in the Pakistani publication Dawn, headlined “Influential expat shields father from long arm of law,” said Awan’s father was facing criminal fraud charges involving a land deal, but Awan used political connections to pressure the police into targeting the alleged victims instead.\\nAwan’s father purchased “huge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008,” but all the checks bounced, the report said.\\n“The police high-ups are ‘ominously’ indifferent to proceed against Awan,” and it’s “noteworthy” how they were “complying with the desires of” Awan, who the paper described as a “White House employee.”\\n“About a dozen farmers of Chak 7-JB, Panjor, including five siblings — all aged between 57 and 70 — have given up hope of justice after they sold their agricultural lands to Ashraf Awan of Bole De Jhugi, who is father of White House employee Shahid Imran,” Dawn reported.\\nImran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan, Virginia court records show.\\nThe police harassed the 19 would-be victims, including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer, and charged them with “frivolous” cases, apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed, the paper said.\\n“Mohammad Abid, a victim of [Ashraf] Awan’s alleged high-profile swindling, said that [Ashraf] Awan’s son had easy access to the corridors of power and that’s why he was able to [pressure] the police to dance to his tunes,” Dawn reported.\\nThe article details a series of people who say they were then subject to retaliation, including widow Bushra Bibi who said, “now Imran was threatening her with dire consequences.”\\nA third source, who’s familiar with Imran Awan, told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened.\\nA fourth source — a fellow House IT aide — previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasinvolved.\\nDr. Zafar Iqbal, one of the alleged victims, told TheDCNF that “Imran came to Pakistan to get [his father] out of jail, since he had some [connections] in the Congress.”\\nAshraf Awan’s business partner in the land deal, Rashid Minhas, told TheDCNF that the elder Awan gave a USB to a Pakistani senator who is a former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency, and that Imran claimed his IT position in Congress gave him the power to “change the U.S. president.” Minhas is in prison for an unrelated fraud charge.\\nOn July 25, 2016, the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family.\\nAwan, his wife, two brothers, his brother’s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz’s Florida.\\nThe finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking.\\nIn February 2017, Kiko and the House’s top law enforcement official, Paul Irving, outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee, and the family was banned from the House computer network.\\nThe letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence.\\nBut Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on “websites” and “printers,” which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access.\\nThe congresswoman also added Awan’s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network.\\nWasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 — 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase.\\nHer actions so rattled the Administration Committee’s Democratic staff director, Jamie Fleet, that he planted a negative story in Politico that revealed Wasserman Schultz, his fellow Democrat, was continuing to pay the suspect, two House sources said.\\nThe story also said Wasserman Schultz had a “friendly personal relationship” with Awan and Alvi.\\nFleet did not respond to a request for comment.\\nKiko said in an April 2018 hearing spurred by the scandal that he was powerless to stop members who refused to fire a bad actor.\\n“Termination, now it’s the member’s responsibility … We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,” he said.\\nHe added that his office should have the authority to override members who would want to keep a rule-breaker on the government network.\\nWasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said.\\nHouse investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence.\\nYet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, “my office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.”\\nWasserman Schultz was defending someone investigators allegedly told her was suspected of cybersecurity violations, despite having resigned from her position as DNC head following a devastating hack during the 2016 election.\\nDespite Wasserman Schultz’s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 — two months after he was banned from the computer network — the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk.\\nCapitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan’s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said “attorney client privilege,” according to a police report.\\nAwan’s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it.\\nThat led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with “consequences” for not returning the laptop.\\nWhen he refused, she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police’s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it.\\nHouse sources told TheDCNF these exchanges were only a public glimpse into numerous such interactions, which were frequently profane, with every official she could buttonhole.\\nOne source said she also went to the Department of Justice and “made a stink.”\\nWasserman Schultz hired the House’s former top lawyer, Bill Pittard — who had recently quit the House — to try to block prosecutors from seeing evidence, TheDCNF previously reported.Awan obtained legal representation from two lawyers who began their careers in Miami — one with experience in espionage cases and the other a former aide to Hillary Clinton.\\nWasserman Schultz’ district includes much of Miami.\\nOne of Awan’s lawyers told a judge he felt “very strongly” that prosecutors should not be able to look at the RepDWS laptop, mounting an attorney-client privilege argument.\\nProsecutors did not challenge the argument before the judge.\\nIn August 2017, Imran and Hina were charged with four felony counts for gathering up money under allegedly false circumstances before wiring $300,000 to Pakistan in January.\\nProsecutors said the timing suggests that the Awans had learned of their investigation, which a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, told TheDCNF was supposed to be secret.\\nCapitol Police “requested that the shared employees be allowed to continue to use their IT credentials until February [2017] because they didn’t want to tip off the employees,” she said.\\nWasserman Schultz’s brother is a prosecutor in the same office handling the case and has tweeted about it.\\nGowen said the wire transfer instead had to do with the land deal, which he told the Washington Examiner was “quickly souring.”\\nWasserman Schultz did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\",\n",

Julian Assange Best Price: $3.04 Buy New $9.55 (as of 06:45 EDT - Details)\\nIn a letter to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, Julian’s father, John Shipton, wrote: “I ask the prime minister to do all within his power to return Julian home before Julian’s situation becomes an irreversible tragedy.” That is why this is such an urgent case of justice toward a single human being as well as a case of a journalistic organization’s right to function and our right to have the information it provides.\\nOnly seven years ago, the current prime minister said that when an Australian citizen is threatened in this way the prime minister should respond.\\nThat was Turnbull before he became prime minister.\\nNow the government is playing its usual role of being the fifty-first state of the United States.\\nIt is a true disgrace.\\nRC: What about Theresa May and the British government?\\nAre they getting pressure from the United States or are there internal reasons why they want to keep Julian Assange quiet?\\nJP: Everything comes down to the relationship with the United States.\\nAustralia has an almost totally servile relationship with America, in which its national security structure, much of its academic life and certainly much of its media is integrated into the US system.\\nThat is not entirely the case in Britain.\\nSince the loss of its empire after the Second World War, Britain has been eager to play a secondary role to the new imperial power.\\nIn many parts of the world, Britain is still the biggest corporate investor.\\nBut it does move in lockstep with the US on much of its foreign policy.\\nIt is interesting to see the corruption that this kind of relationship produces.\\nInformation has come out that the Crown Prosecution Service tried to prevent the Swedes from giving up the case against Julian on bogus sexual assault charges.\\nThe pressure was on from London to keep it going.\\nJulian is also seen as defying a system and that is just not acceptable.\\nThere is a real element of vindictiveness here.\\nThe Crown Prosecution Service kept this case going when otherwise the European warrant put out by the Swedes would have been abandoned in 2013.\\nWhen Julian came up to a bail hearing last year, it was an absolute disgrace.\\nThe judge described Julian’s circumstances as if he were on some sort of extended vacation.\\nWhat didn’t emerge was the whole conflict of interest in this hearing.\\nThe judge’s husband is a figure deep within the national security establishment in Britain who was named in WikiLeaks documents.\\nBecause there is no serious media examining the whole WikiLeaks witch hunt, virtually none of this emerges.\\nDB: The corporate press has a major responsibility if Julian Assange goes down, don’t you agree?\\nJP: As you know, Dennis, governments do respond to pressure from powerful media interests.\\nIt rarely happens but when it does governments do change their tune.\\nThere has been no pressure from media in the United States, Britain, Australia or pretty much anywhere except in programs like yours outside the mainstream.\\nYou are absolutely right in that the responsibility of journalists for what has happened to Julian Assange and what might happen to WikiLeaks is undeniable.\\nI was looking this morning at a report by Media Lens in Britain describing how the British press has reported on Julian Assange.\\nIt describes the tsunami of vindictive personal abuse that has been heaped upon Julian from well-known journalists, many claiming liberal credentials.\\nThe Guardian, which used to consider itself the most enlightened newspaper in the country, has probably been the worst.\\nThe frontal attacks have been coming not from governments but from journalists.\\nI described this recently as “Vichy journalism,” a term which now fits so much of the mainstream media.\\nIt collaborates in the same way that the Vichy government in France collaborated with the Nazis.\\nThe WikiLeaks Files: T... WikiLeaks Best Price: $2.75 Buy New $7.00 (as of 12:00 EDT - Details) There used to be spaces within the so-called mainstream for unbiased discussion, for the airing of real grievances and injustices.\\nThese spaces have closed completely.\\nThe attacks on Julian Assange illustrate what has happened to the so-called free media in the West.\\nI have been a journalist for a very long time and I have always worked within the mainstream, but the journalism I see now is part of a rapacious establishment and one of its prime targets is Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.\\nThis is precisely because WikiLeaks is producing the kind of journalism that they ought to be doing.\\nWikiLeaks has in fact shamed journalists, which might help to explain the deeply personal abuse he has suffered.\\nWikiLeaks has revealed what journalists should have revealed a long time ago.\\nDB: Even the attorney for the New York Times happened to mention that if Julian Assange gets prosecuted, the Times could get prosecuted under the same laws.\\nJP: It could but I don’t believe it would be, because power respects power.\\nThe New York Times is part of the establishment.\\nThe difference with WikiLeaks is that it is outside of the establishment and is truly independent.\\nDB: What would be your strongest plea for Julian Assange?\\nJP: It’s very simple.\\nThis is about justice.\\nIn a famous speech given in the 1930’s by Parson Martin Niemoller, he said that first the Nazis came for socialists, but he didn’t speak up because that didn’t concern him.\\nThen they came for trade unionists, but he didn’t speak up because that didn’t concern him.\\nHe didn’t speak up when they came for the Jews because he wasn’t a Jew.\\nAnd, of course, finally they came for him.\\nThat might not be a precise parallel, but if Julian Assange is allowed to literally go under, it represents the conquest of all of us.\\nIt means that we have kept quiet.\\nKeeping quiet has allowed the great atrocities of histories to take place.\\nIf Julian is allowed to be spirited away to some super-max hellhole, it will be a great atrocity.\\nDB: In the library, silence is golden.\\nIn the world of human rights, silence equals mass murder.\\nThey say you shouldn’t yell fire in a crowded theater just to get a reaction.\\nBut if you know the theater is in fact on fire and you do not shout out, what happens after is your responsibility.\\nReprinted with permission from Consortiumnews.com.\\n',\n",

outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the number of cases has risen by 50%, and The World Health Organization has now said it is preparing for “the worst case scenario.”\\nThe WHO has tallied 32 suspected or confirmed cases in the northwestern area of Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumbathe near the border with the Republic of Congo, including 18 deaths, between April 4 and May 9.\\nThe outbreak, declared by the DRC health ministry on Tuesday, is the DRC’s ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976,when the deadly viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.\\nScientists are greatly concerned that this outbreak in the remote Bikoro region will travel 175 miles to the city of Mbandaka – the capital of Equateur province and home to around 1.2 million residents.\\nWe’ve updated this map.\\nTurns out that the provincial capital of Equateur, Mbandaka, is home to roughly 1M people.\\nIt’s less than 300 km or 175 miles from Bikoro and reachable by water.\\npic.twitter.com\/3Q3PwAAdsh — Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) May 11, 2018\\nWhat’s worrisome is that the most recent WHO update says that there are two probable cases at

running this weekend, similar to the one set up by the WHO.\\nThe WHO and World Food Programme are also working to set up an ‘air-bridge’ to help bring in supplies, however, only helicopters can be used until an airfield is cleared to allow larger planes to land, Mr Salama added.\\nThe health body has released £738,000 ($1m) from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to support response

who contract it.\\nEbola, a haemorrhagic fever, killed at least 11,000 across the world after it decimated West Africa and spread rapidly over the space of two years.\\nThe pandemic was officially declared over back in January 2016, when Liberia was announced to be Ebola-free by the WHO.\\nThe country, rocked by back-to-back civil wars that ended in 2003, was hit the hardest by the fever, with 40 per cent of the deaths having occurred there.\\nSierra Leone reported the highest number of Ebola cases, with nearly of all those infected having been residents of the nation.\\n-Daily

waterway used for transport and commerce.\\nDownstream lies Kinshasa and Brazzaville – the DRC’s capital.\\nThe two cities are home to a combined 12 million people.\\nAs such, neighboring countries are on high alert.\\nOfficials in Nigeria, Guinea and Gambia have incresaed screening measures along their airports and borders, measures which helped contain the virus during the West African epidemic that began in 2013.\\nAngola, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Burundi and the Republic of Congo – which border the DRC – have all been alerted.\\nWhile Kenya, which does not border the country, has issued warnings over the possible spread of Ebola.\\nThermal guns to detect anyone with a fever have been put in place along its border

safe.\\n-Daily Mail\\nScientists believe Ebola is most often passed to humans by fruit bats, however porcupines, gorillas, antelope and chimpanzees could also be carriers.\\nIt is transmitted between humans through blood, secretions and other bodily fluids (and surfaces) of those infected.\\nThere is currently no “proven” treatment for Ebola, however dozens of experimental drugs exist – including

support us with cryptocurrency donations.\\nThank you!\\nFor decades, Americans have known that very sick things happen behind the scenes in Washington D.C., but the mainstream media nearly really talks about any of it.\\nBut now the curtain is starting to be pulled back, and the revelations about Al Franken are just the beginning.\\nEarlier this week, I wrote an article about how “sexual harassment is rampant in the halls of Congress”, and that was before a female radio anchor named LeeAnn Tweeden revealed that Al Franken had “forcibly kissed” and groped her during a USO tour in 2006.\\nThe following comes from an article in which Tweeden shared her story…\\nI couldn’t believe it.\\nHe groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep.\\nI felt violated all over again.\\nEmbarrassed.\\nBelittled.\\nHumiliated.\\nHow dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it’s funny?\\nI told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.\\nI wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster.\\nBut that was then, this is now.\\nI’m no longer afraid.\\nWhen the story initially broke, Franken rushed to issue an apology…\\n“I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,” said Franken.\\n“As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t.\\nI shouldn’t have done it.”\\nNeedless to say, many were completely unsatisfied with Franken’s very weak statement.\\nIn fact, some members of his own party said that his apology was entirely insufficient and are calling for Franken to be held accountable for his actions…\\nGuy Cecil, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and now the boss of a leading Democratic super PAC, voiced his frustration with the inadequacy of Franken’s apology on Twitter.\\n“That was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,” Cecil tweeted.\\n“Al Franken must be held accountable if our party wants to live up to our commitment to women & girls.”\\nThis scandal has set off a feeding frenzy as Internet sleuths search for other incidents in which Franken has acted inappropriately.\\nAnd of course, since we are talking about Al Franken, it wasn’t exactly difficult to find material.\\nFor example, a photo has surfaced of Franken grabbing Joy Behar in a very creepy manner.\\nThe following comes from Breitbart…\\nAmid the emergence of a 2006 photo of Al Franken groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, a photo of the embattled Minnesota Senator appearing to grab comedian Joy Behar’s breast has also resurfaced.\\nFranken was a comedian before he ever entered the world of politics, and we understand that.\\nBut just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules.\\nThere appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past…\\nFranken, then a comedian, was quoted in a 1995 New York Magazine article discussing a skit for “Saturday Night Live” that involved drugging and raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl.\\nFranken, at the time a writer for “SNL,” suggested one skit should play out with “60 Minutes” commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk.\\n“’I give the pills to Lesley Stahl.\\nThen when Lesley is passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.’ Or ‘That’s why you never see Lesley until February.’ Or, ‘When she passes out.\\nI put her in various positions and take pictures of her,’” Franken was quoted saying.\\nThe article, along with a 2000 Playboy column in which Franken talked about fantasizing a machine would perform oral sex on him, was used to attack Franken during his 2008 Senate campaign in Minnesota.\\nAs much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington.\\nLet’s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment.\\nDemocrats have been covering up his sexual crimes for years, and my hope is that now this will start to change.\\nJuanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James, Christy Zercher, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Susie Whitacre and Bobbie Ann William are some of the women that have made allegations against Clinton, and if even half of their allegations are true Clinton should be in prison for the rest of his life.\\nIn my article yesterday, I discussed how one Secret Service agent is charging former Vice-President Joe Biden of engaging in “Weinstein-level” behavior, and I also talked about how 15 million dollars in settlements have been secretly paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House of Representatives in recent years.\\nThere is a culture of corruption in Washington D.C., and we desperately need to drain the swamp.\\nIf you agree, I hope that you will support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates that want to clean up the halls of Congress.\\nIt is time to take our government back because at this point it has become an absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and corruption.\\nArticle posted with permission from End of the American Dream\\n',\n",

       " {'text': \"National Data | December Jobs—TRUMP EFFECT!\\nAmerican Worker Displacement, Immigrant Population, Black Unemployment ALL DECLINE!\\n| Articles\\n\\n)\\nForget the Wolff book brouhaha and Trump’s latest DACA dalliance —the real story is outside the Beltway , where real people live and work.\\nDecember marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working-age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year.\\nSimultaneously, immigrant displacement of American workers fell, also apparently confirming a trend that began in September.\\nAnd, by the way, black unemployment is at a record low.\\nWhat started after the 2016 election as a reduction in the rate of increase in the foreign-born population of working age has turned into an outright retreat.\\nThis is in dramatic contrast to the last months of the Obama Regime, which saw year-over-year increases in immigrant working-age population far in excess of the estimated 1 million legal immigrants admitted annually, and which I argued meant that an unreported illegal alien surge was underway.\\nAccording to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday, December there were 77,000 fewer working-age immigrants (legal and illegal) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016—a decline of 0.18%.\\nThis follows year-over-year drops of 138,000 in August, 143,000 in September, and 117,000 in October, and 64,000 in November.\\nNot since the Great Recession has the foreign-born working-age population declined for five consecutive months—but now, in telling contrast, the economy is expanding.\\nThis makes the Trump Era immigrant workforce decline especially striking.\\nNote that this is a net figure.\\nThe year-over- year reduction in the immigrant working-age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in.\\nAbout 300,000 immigrants die annually, and an equal number leave (voluntarily or otherwise), according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies.\\n[U.S.\\nImmigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016, By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period—the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants.\\nThis helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime).\\nThe additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers’ immigrant status (but not their legal status).\\nThe Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month—well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely-cited Payroll Survey.\\nIn December 2017:\\nImmigrant employment fell by 246,000, down by 0.93%\\nNative-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 – up 0.27%\\nThe immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell from 122.0 to 120.9.\\nThe native-born American employment index rose from 105.8 to 106.0..\\nThe New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell fromto(100X (120.9\/106.0))\\nTrump may not have delivered (yet) on his promise to bring back the factory and coal jobs so many of his supporters lost during the Obama years.\\nBut by shrinking the pool of immigrants willing to do that work, he has put more money in pockets of his voters.\\nWhile overall wage growth remains modest – 2.5% per annum in December – Blue collar workers have beat this by a wide margin:\\n“It is commonly said that wage stagnation contributed to an economic anxiety in middle America that carried Donald Trump into the White House…Yet Mr. Trump’s rise seems to have coincided with a turnaround in fortunes for the middle class.\\n… The latest development—one that will be of particular interest to Mr. Trump—is that blue-collar wages have begun to rocket.\\n…In the year [2017] to the third quarter, wage and salary growth for the likes of factory workers, builders and drivers easily outstripped that for professionals and managers.\\nIn some cases, blue-collar pay growth now exceeds 4%…” Blue-collar wages are surging.\\nCan it last?, The Economist, Magazine, November 14th 2017\\nEleven months of Trump has not come close to undoing the damage done by eight years of Obama.\\nNative-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years and this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election:\\nCan't render, error\\nNative-born American employment growth is represented by the black line, immigrant employment growth is in pink, and NVAWDI—the ratio of immigrant to native-born American job growth—is in blue.\\nAnother way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment rose steadily, albeit erratically, throughout the Obama years.\\nIt fell sharply in the months after the 2016 election, but roared back to Obama-era levels in the spring.\\nImmigrants held 16.99% of total jobs in December, a significant drop from November’s 17.16% share.\\nCan't render, error\\nA detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report.\\nOver the last 12 months (December 2016 to December 2017):\\nThe native-born American labor force (employed plus looking for work) grew twice as fast as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.\\nADVANTAGE AMERICANS\\nas the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.\\nAmerican employment grew 57% faster than immigrant employment: 1.27% versus 0.81%.\\nADVANTAGE AMERICANS\\nThe labor-force participation rate (LPR), a sign of worker confidence and mobility, rose by 0.6 points for immigrants and was unchanged for native-born Americans.\\nAt 65.3%, the immigrant LPR this December was considerably above the native-born American rate (61.9%.)\\nADVANTAGE IMMIGRANTS\\nThe number of unemployed Americans fell by 763,000—down 12.7%, while the number of unemployed immigrants fell 129,000—down by 11%.\\nADVANTAGE AMERICANS\\nAnother piece of good news, quite possibly connected to the shrinking of the immigrant working age population, caught our eye: The unemployment rate for black Americans fell to 6.8% in December , the lowest level since the Labor Department began tracking the figure in 1972.\\n[ U.S. economy added 2 million jobs in 2017 , by Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoney, January 5, 2018]\\nBy removing foreign competitors, Trump may have done more for blacks in 11 months than Obama did in eight years.\\nOf course, this could be affected by statistical noise—and it could be undone by e.g.\\na DACA capitulation.\\nBut right now it increasingly appears the Trump Effect is real—and achieved entirely through enhanced enforcement.\\nWhat could happen if the GOP-controlled Congress woke up and enacted an immigration moratorium?\\nEdwin S. Rubenstein (email him) is President of ESR Research Economic Consultants.\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': 'New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”\\n\\nIt should be clear by now that the entire official narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 people dead and hundreds injured is falling apart.\\nFrom shooter Paddock’s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny.\\nIn the last 24 hours the Sheriff’s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard.\\nOriginally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack.\\nAs it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite.\\nAs part of the constantly changing story, officials are now saying that police officers who rushed to the hotel room when the shooting began didn’t know a hotel security guard had been shot “until they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,” Lombardo said.\\nThe security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor.\\nPaddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said.\\nPaddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes.\\nPolice officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor.\\nAnd Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities.\\nWhat’s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre.\\nThe hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw “multiple gunmen.” The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre\\nAs of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times:\\nThe new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important:\\nWhat happened during the 6 minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire, and why weren’t the police rushing to the scene immediately?\\nWhy did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting?\\nPaddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes.\\nPolice didn’t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped – which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit.\\nMoreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor?\\nOr is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic?\\nAccording to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high:\\nLatest LV Sheriff: Saying they still don’t know why he stopped shooting.\\n@drawandstrike theory looking plausiblehttps:\/\/t.co\/CQF3MZLHaN — Mr Alex ???\\n(@New_England_) October 10, 2017\\nWhile we may never know the exact circumstances surrounding what transpired in the shooter’s hotel room, the information being released not just by law enforcement, but witnesses to the event who recorded hundreds of cumulative hours of video and audio, now calls the entirety official story into question.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Exposing the Deep State Plotters\\n\\nPresident Trump’s sweeping order this week directing intelligence agencies to declassify documents from the more than 18-month-old investigation related to the Left’s electoral collusion conspiracy theory involving Trump and Russia may shed light on what really happened in the 2016 election.\\nIn an interview with Hill.TV yesterday, the president said he ordered the mass declassification to show the public that the FBI investigation of the conspiracy theory began as a “hoax.” Exposing it could be one of the “crowning achievements” of his presidency, he said.\\n“What we’ve done is a great service to the country, really,” he said.\\n“I hope to be able to call this, along with tax cuts and regulation and all the things I’ve done… in its own way this might be the most important thing because this was corrupt.”\\nTrump criticized how the FBI handled the Russia probe, accusing it of misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court, and of spying on his campaign.\\n“They know this is one of the great scandals in the history of our country because basically what they did is, they used [former Trump campaign aide] Carter Page, who nobody even knew, who I feel very badly for, I think he’s been treated very badly.\\nThey used Carter Page as a foil in order to surveil a candidate for the presidency of the United States.”\\n“It’s a hoax, beyond a witch hunt,” Trump said.\\nThe documents affected involve a FISA warrant against Carter Page and text messages from disgraced ex-FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\\n(Carter Page is not related to Lisa Page.)\\nAlthough the conspiracy theory is baseless nonsense, it continues to dog the Trump administration, providing cable television news outlets and late-night talk show hosts with endless fodder in the 24-hour news cycle.\\nWhen Trump defenders have fought back, social media companies have colluded with the Left to silence and intimidate them.\\nThis declassification effort won’t make things any worse than they are for President Trump.\\nIt may even prove a political masterstroke of sorts for Trump.\\nHow else does one fight back against the nameless, faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State who hide behind anonymity to undermine the duly elected 45th president of the United States?\\nMake the documents public and let the chips fall where they may.\\nThere is so much leftist dirt to uncover.\\nFor example, it was established some time ago that former President Obama was involved on some level in this shameful un-American plot to rig the 2016 election and undermine his successor by using the privacy-invading apparatus of the state.\\nObama wanted “to know everything” the FBI was doing in its investigation into claims that Russia was interfering in the 2016 election.\\nSpecifically, the statement that Obama wanted “to know everything we’re doing” came in a private Sept. 2, 2016, text message from FBI lawyer Lisa Page to FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she was having an extramarital affair at the time.\\n(The exact message, time-stamped 1:50 p.m., reads \"Yes, bc potus wants to know everything we are doing.\")\\nIn a separate text message to Page, Strzok wrote something cryptic about an “insurance policy” in case Donald Trump got elected.\\nApparently, he was referring to the salacious, unverified dossier Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid rent-a-spy Christopher Steele to compile that purports to show Trump’s nefarious links to Russia.\\nPresident Trump ordered that the relevant documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,” read a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\\nTrump ordered the “immediate declassification” of “pages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page,” “all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation,” and “all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications.”\\nTrump also ordered the “the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr.”\\nThe chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Devin Nunes (R -Calif.), reportedly hailed Trump’s order, saying it covers “pretty much everything that he wanted … and the text messages are a bonus.”\\nA handful of Democratic lawmakers alarmed at the prospect of being exposed as frauds and publicly humiliated wrote Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday.\\nThe letter, which is an attempt to usurp the powers vested in the president, asks the three agencies to defy the presidential directive.\\n\"Your agencies\\' review, and any communication with the White House on the substance of the material, should not proceed further until you have briefed the Gang of Eight in person.\"\\nIt claims that Trump’s declassification request constitutes improper intervention “in an ongoing law enforcement investigation that may implicate the President himself or those around him.”\\nThe authors of the letter even lie about the nature of the broad-based request, claiming Trump is selectively declassifying information to save himself.\\n“The action he has taken, to direct your agencies to selectively disclose classified information that he believes he can manipulate publicly to undermine the legitimacy and credibility of the Special Counsel’s [Robert Mueller] investigation, is a brazen abuse of power.”\\nThe missive is signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who is vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\\nIntelligence agencies have already reportedly begun working to carry out the president’s orders and the first set of documents could be made public in a few days.\\n“When the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America’s national security interests,” a Justice Department official told Fox News.\\n“The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”\\nCoats spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was “working expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.”\\nAccording to Fox News:\\nThe documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant.\\nThe 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format.\\nThe June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.\\nIn comments to reporters and on Twitter, President Trump has been blasting Strzok and Page for months over their inappropriate behavior.\\nDitto for former FBI Director James Comey and one of his deputies, Andrew McCabe.\\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017 and Attorney General Jeff Sessions canned McCabe in March.\\nPage left the FBI in May and Strzok got the axe last month.\\nThat means there are still thousands of unaccountable Deep State operatives in the Trump administration that have yet to be dealt with.\\n',\n",

Gregory, as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, infamously spoke of “an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.”\\nBut that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se.\\nRather, the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more (shall we say) opportunities for gay men – given that there are, of course, no women in Catholic seminaries.\\nThis began driving away heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals who upheld the Church’s teachings on chastity and celibacy.\\nNeedless to say, not all gay priests are violent predators like McCarrick.\\nBut the toleration of sexually active priests gave McCarrick cover to “seduce” his victims.\\nMany have also speculated that, because McCarrick’s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent, the media didn’t consider them newsworthy.\\nIf he’d fondled a 12-year old altar boy, that would have been one thing.\\nPedophile priests sell papers.\\nBut taking an 18-year-old seminarian to bed?\\nRunning that story would simply be outing a closeted gay man: an act the liberal press would no doubt consider “homophobic”, as Ross Douthat pointed out.\\nMeanwhile, those bishops who didn’t approve of his actions knew the culture – both within the Church and without her – were against them.\\nThe post-Vatican Church doesn’t like to come off as a nag.\\nShe’s not going to cause a fuss by purging sexually active gay men from the clergy just because… what?\\nIt’s immoral?\\nThat’s not very aggiornamentistic!\\nThe world and our worldly bishops were, unsurprisingly, of one mind.\\nAnd even if they were disgusted by McCarrick, these prelates weren’t willing to jeopardize their careers by standing for justice against vice.\\nWe seem to be slouching back to the old traditionalist trope: All the Church’s problems would be solved if we’d just go back to the Latin Mass.\\nSomething went critically wrong during Vatican II that extends well beyond the Mass.\\nAnd we can’t drag the Church out of her present crisis until we have the courage to brave accusations of “Lefebvrism” and say so.\\nThose who love our Holy Mother – those who want to protect her boys and men from all the McCarricks and their perverse appetites – mustn’t be deceived into thinking this is a small or an isolated issue.\\nIt isn’t.\\nThis is the crisis of an ancient and immortal institution trying desperately to seem young and fashionable; like all old men, it only manages to come across as lecherous and pathetic.\\nIts obsession with “modernization” leads it to only adopt the vices of modernity.\\nInstead of serving as ambassadors from the City of God, far too many of our priests and prelates have become agents of the City of Man.\\nI don’t know what it will take to set things right.\\nI don’t know what it will take to exorcise the “spirit of Vatican II” – the spirit of aggiornamento – from the Church.\\nBut we will.\\nChrist promised.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': '9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad\\n\\n[Pre-Order Jamie Glazov\\'s new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us, HERE.]\\nEditors’ note: In light of the skyrocketing phenomenon of Muslim migrants stabbing unbelievers in random stabbing sprees in Europe, as well as the calculated denial that leaders, authorities and media are enforcing about it, Frontpage has deemed it important to bring attention to the crucial steps America and the West must take to robustly confront the unceasing onslaught by Jihad and its leftist enablers.\\nWe are, therefore, reprinting below Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov’s July 12, 2016 Breitbart article, \"9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad\".\\nHaving written the article in the closing chapter of the disastrous Obama administration, the author recognizes and celebrates the life-saving turn-around disposition that the Trump administration has brought in to counter Jihad.\\nFrontpage is most confident that the suggested steps below will continue to be the overall focus of the new administration -- which, thankfully, is now taking many of the crucial and constructive steps vis-à-vis our enemy.\\nWe find the article more relevant and urgent than ever due to the 17th anniversary of 9\/11 approaching tomorrow:\\n*\\n9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.\\nBy Jamie Glazov\\nWhile the Obama administration continues to allow the Muslim Brotherhood to direct American foreign policy and, therefore, to implement “strategies” that render America defenseless in the face of Jihad and stealth Jihad, there are some alternative strategies that have the potential to turn this catastrophic situation around completely in America’s favor.\\nBelow are 9 concrete steps that, if implemented by a future American administration, would make a big difference in preserving our civilization and in defending Americans from terrorism:\\n1.\\nLabel the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment.\\nThe Obama administration continues to refuse to label our enemy and, therefore, it continues to enable our defeat in the terror war.\\nIt is urgent that we name our enemy (i.e.\\nIslamic Jihad) and definitively identify what ideology inspires our enemy (i.e.\\nIslamic law).\\n2.\\nScrap “Countering Violent Extremism.”\\n“Countering Violent Extremism” is the pathetic and destructive focus of the Obama administration in allegedly fighting the terror war.\\nOn the one hand, this “focus” is vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us.\\nOn the other hand, this focus allows the administration to perpetuate the destructive fantasy that there are other types of “extremists” — who just happen to be the Left’s political opponents — that pose a great threat to the country.\\nFor example, as Stephen Coughlin has revealed, the “violent extremists” the administration is clearly worried about are the “right-wing Islamophobes” whom the administration obviously considers to be the real threat to American security.\\nThe “Countering Violent Extremism” is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage.\\n3.\\nStop “Partnering” With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups.\\nThe government needs to stop cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately.\\nThe Muslim Brotherhood document, the Explanatory Memorandum, has made it clear that the Brotherhood’s objective is to destroy our civilization from within by our own hands with the influence of these groups.\\nMoreover, as Robert Spencer advises, there needs to be legislation that will bar all such groups and affiliated individuals from advising the government or receiving any grants from it.\\n4.\\nImplement a Concrete “Countering-Jihad” Strategy.\\nAfter discarding the “Countering Violent Extremism” absurdity, a concrete Counter-Jihad strategy must become an official policy.\\nIt must specifically register that Jihadists are the enemies and that Islamic law (Sharia) is what specifically motivates them.\\nMost importantly, as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, the government needs to lay down a vision, an actual “threat doctrine analysis” in a thorough document, just like George Kennan’s Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War.\\nIt is absolutely mind-boggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war — and it is a reflection of the Left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing.\\n5.\\nLaunch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.\\nThe Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24\/7.\\nWhat does our propaganda war entail?\\nZilch.\\nSebastian Gorka is crucially correct, therefore, when he recommends a national counter-propaganda campaign that involves a two-part approach: the first being the bolstering of efforts to define our enemy (Steps #1 and #4 above) and, second, the strengthening of our allies and partners in their own counter-propaganda efforts – which must include our empowering of Muslims who are trying to form an anti-Jihadist version of Islam.\\nConsequently, educational programs have to be set up everywhere, from public schools to universities to workplaces, in businesses and numerous other institutions.\\nThese programs must crystallize what exactly Islamic Law is and how it inspires and sanctions violence against unbelievers.\\nThis has to also involve, as Gorka urges, “a nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal, state, and local police forces and the intelligence community.”\\nThe education campaign must also focus on the second part of Gorka’s counter-propaganda campaign, which is to help strengthen Muslims who seek to seize Islam from the jihadists’ hands.\\n6.\\nAffirm Sharia’s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious.\\nOnce the truth is accepted that jihadis are inspired and sanctioned by their Islamic texts, it must logically become required that mosques, Islamic schools and groups have to immediately curtail any teaching that motivates sedition, violence, and hatred of unbelievers (i.e.\\nremember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI).\\nIndeed, once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution, any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious.\\n7.\\nPut Pressure on Mosques, Islamic Groups and Schools.\\nAuthorities have to start subjecting mosques and other Islamic institutions to surveillance — and discard the suicidal leftist notion that it is “racist” and Islamophobic to do so.\\nIslamic institutions have to be made to buffer their lip-service against terror with actually doing something about it.\\nAs Robert Spencer counsels, this has to involve introducing programs that teach against jihadists’ understanding of Islam — and these programs have to be regularly monitored by the government.\\n(This will be a part of Gorka’s suggested counter-propaganda campaign discussed in Step #5).\\nSpencer rightly stresses that the paradigm has to become that Muslim communities have to win the “trust” of intelligence and law enforcement agents, rather than the other way around, which is, absurdly and tragically, the case right now.\\n8.\\nBring Counter-Jihadists into the Government.\\nInstead of having Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers like Mohamed Elibiary serving on the U.S.\\nHomeland Security Advisory Council (he “resigned” in Sept. 2014 under mysterious circumstances), and Muslim Brotherhood-linked individuals like Huma Abedin serving as the right-hand woman of Hillary Clinton, we need to bring in people who actually love America and want to protect it.\\nWe all know who these noble and courageous individuals are – and some of them are referenced in this article.\\nThe government must also bring in brave Muslim individuals who genuinely reject Jihad and empower them in propagating their anti-jihadist vision for Islam.\\n(P.S.\\nYes, there is an argument to be made that Islam cannot be Islam without Jihad.\\nBut the debate over this belongs in another forum.\\nAnd whatever the answer, it does not mean that the effort to empower Muslims who want to make the anti-jihadist Islamic vision possible should not be made.)\\n9.\\nRidicule the Enemy.\\nRidicule is a vicious and potent weapon.\\nThere is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture’s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Sharia and Jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.\\nBill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit.\\nAmerican comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher’s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so – and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.\\nWe must never underestimate the crippling effect of comedy on the totalitarian Mullahs of the world.\\nIndeed, the contemptuous, snickering and roaring laughter of people, as they gaze at the pathetic rules and lives of Sharia’s gatekeepers, poses a danger to tyrants like no other.\\nJamie Glazov holds a Ph.D. in History with a specialty in Russian, U.S. and Canadian foreign policy.\\nHe is the editor of

       " {'text': \"Israel Takes On the Shia Crescent\\n\\nDespite Israel's repeated warnings, Barack Obama's reckless appeasement of the Iranian regime has enabled its rise as a hegemonic threat in the Middle East region as well as a threat to international peace and security.\\nIn 2009, Obama turned his back on millions of dissidents in the streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities, who were peacefully protesting the rigged election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president.\\nIn 2011, Obama precipitously removed the remaining U.S. combat troops from Iraq, giving rise to ISIS’s re-emergence in Iraq from its bases in Syria.\\nThe radical Shiite Iranian regime purported to come to the “rescue” of both countries from the Sunni terrorists, turning Iraq into a virtual vassal state of the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the process.\\nObama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran legitimized Iran's path to eventually becoming a nuclear-armed state, while immediately filling its coffers with billions of dollars to fund its aggression.\\nMeanwhile, Syria has become ground zero for Iran's execution of its regional ambitions, which is to establish its Shiite Crescent connecting with its allies, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.\\nThis plan has included the establishment of a land route that Iranian-backed militias secured in June, beginning on Iran’s border with Iraq and running across Iraq and Syria all the way to Syria’s Mediterranean coast.\\nThis road makes Iran’s job easier in supplying arms by land, as well as by air and sea, to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and to equip Iran’s own forces fighting inside of Syria in support of Assad.\\nThis helps explain why Iran has placed so much importance on helping the Syrian regime establish control over the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border.\\n“Everything depends now on the Americans’ willingness to stop this,” said an Iraqi Kurdish official who was quoted in a New Yorker article.\\nHowever, U.S.-led coalition forces apparently have done next to nothing to stop this major advance in Iran’s Shiite Crescent expansion.\\n“Obama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly, by the time this administration took over,” said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\\n“The Iranian influence is spreading because they are so heavily involved in regime activities,” Tabler added.\\n“It’s a new monster.”\\nFurthermore, Iran has funded and armed its terrorist proxy Hezbollah, which has sent its militia from its home base of Lebanon to fight alongside Assad's forces.\\nAnd Iran has used Syria as a transit point for shipment of sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon for future use against Israeli population centers.\\nDespite the fact that Hezbollah has American blood on its hands, the U.S.-led coalition has chosen not to do anything about Hezbollah’s presence in Syria, bought and paid for by Iran.\\nWhile Israel chose not to take sides in Syria's civil war with military intervention of its own, it has bombed weapons storage facilities and convoys inside Syria for its own protection.\\nJust recently, on September 7th, Israeli jets struck a Syrian weapons facility near Masyaf, which was reported to have been used for the production of chemical weapons and the storage of missiles.\\nIsrael will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian-backed forces if they edge too close to areas near the Golan Heights, shrinking the buffer between Israel and Iranian controlled territories.\\nHowever, such tactical measures may not be enough to thwart Iran’s larger ambitions.\\nIn light of intelligence reports that Assad may be ready to invite Iran to set up military bases in Syria, Israeli leaders have concluded that they cannot wait until the Trump administration decides to deal more forcefully with Iran's growing use of Syria as a staging area for carrying out its expansionist Shiite Crescent strategy.\\n“Their overriding concern in Syria is the free reign that all the major players there seem willing to afford Iran and its various proxies in the country,” wrote Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy.\\nAs long as nobody else is addressing the concern Iran’s growing control raises in a satisfactory manner, “Israel is determined to continue addressing it on its own.”\\nAt least, Israel has a more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration than it did in the Obama administration for raising its concerns about Iran’s growing threat, not only to Israel but to U.S. interests in the region and beyond.\\nPresident Trump’s sharp denunciation of the Iranian regime during his address to the UN General Assembly represented a welcome departure from the Obama administration’s milquetoast approach to Iran.\\nAs the U.S.-led coalition continues to drive ISIS from its bases of operation in Syria, the Trump administration has proclaimed its intention not to allow Iran to turn Syria into its own satellite, as Iran has essentially done in Iraq.\\nNational Security Adviser H.R.\\nMcMaster said that the “so called liberation of areas by Assad’s forces and Iranian proxies could actually accelerate the cycle of violence and perpetuate conflict rather than get us to a sustainable outcome.” He claimed that the Trump administration’s “objectives are to weaken Iranian influence across the region broadly,” without discussing the means to accomplish those objectives.\\nWhether the Trump administration follows through remains to be seen.\\nIn the meantime, Israel will have to deal with the fallout of Iran’s ambitions in Syria itself.\\n\",\n",

in West Virginia is “instructing junior high students to write the Islamic profession of faith ostensibly to practice calligraphy.” Students are made to write out the Shahada, which states: “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.”This is exactly what I warned about in my book, Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance , in the chapter “The Mosqueing of the Public Schools.”In order to convert to Islam, one says the shahada.\\nSaying the shahada makes you a Muslim.\\nThe shahada is what is on the black flag of jihad.\\nNo non-Muslim student should be forced to write or say the shahada without the qualifier “Muslims believe that…” This is because it is a statement of faith.\\nIf the school exercise is requiring students to write it, it should be clear from the wording of the exercise that this is Islamic faith, not the student’s faith.\\nThat distinction has been glossed over in many, many school textbook presentations.\\nThis is in West Virginia, not Baghdad.\\nAnd it’s a problem not just in West Virginia – it’s a national problem.\\ntake our poll - story continues below\\nWhom do you consider to be

grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\\nYou may opt out at anytime.\\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\\nRich Penkoski, the father of a Mountain Ridge student, contacted me and explained the situation further.\\nHe sent me the packets the school gave out for the Jewish and the Christian lessons and commented:\\nNotice no bible verses, no reciting the 10 commandments or the Lord’s prayer.\\nNo practicing writing in Hebrew (not even the 10 commandments) as compared to the Islamic packet.\\nThere are no statements of faith, nothing asking the students to write it or practice in any of the Jewish or Christian rituals.\\nFurthermore the principal of Mountain Ridge Middle School Dr.\\nBranch has used my words against me by saying the teacher did tell the students about the Lord’s prayer (my daughter as well as 1 other said this is false)[.]\\nHe is using my arguments I made to him yesterday to protect the teacher.\\nThe teacher today told the students the assignment was optional.\\nMy daughter as well as other students were under the impression all the packet assignments were mandatory (the Jewish one and the Christian ones were mandatory).\\nI wrote to Dr.\\nBranch to share with him the resource that Miss Hinson used and point out that the material she gave the students did not include all the faith aspects for Christianity.\\nThe students received 2 pages for Christianity from this resource while all the Islamic sections were left intact.\\nHere’s the link for you to review.\\nYou will notice all the faith elements were left out for Judaism and Christianity while the Islamic section was left the way it’s presented.\\nhttps:\/\/www.gvsd.org\/cms\/lib\/PA01001045\/Centricity\/Domain\/610\/World%20Religions.pdf So she decided to use the extra resources for Islam and the school is saying that’s not indoctrination or proselytizing?\\nThe faith aspects and the same considerations were not given to the others as they were for Islam.\\nThis actually further proves my point that Islam was afforded special privilege over the others.\\nThe school is backtracking and being deceptive to try and weasel out of this.\\nThe teacher today clarified things for the students but that still does not excuse the fact that they are teaching the Islamic faith and asking the kids to participate in Sharia.\\nLook at the Islamic packet again.\\nThey are asking the kids to write the beginning of Surahs.\\nThe teacher still has not corrected the error that calligraphy was started by the arabs.\\nThey are doubling down and only after being called on it are they trying to backtrack.\\nRich Penkoski is hardly the first to protest this egregious submission to the most vicious and brutal ideology on the face of the Earth.\\nIn Volusia County, Florida, hundreds protested Islamic lessons in their “World History” text, a Common Core-approved high school history textbook.\\nWith an entire chapter dedicated to the virtues of Islam and not a single chapter for Christianity, the textbook had Floridians in a frenzy.\\nAnd who is the biggest pusher of Common Core besides leftist progressives?\\nThe Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim Brotherhood front group, along with the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).\\nIn Florida, CAIR is on the offensive (more here).\\nWe have seen the increasing Islamization of the public-school curriculum.\\nHistory lessons in Islam are dawah – proselytizing for Islam.\\nLarge public-school publishers have been bought by the Saudis.\\nIn West Virginia, it gets even worse.\\nRich Penkoski has alerted me to the latest development in the forced Islamization of his children’s school curriculum: after the Daily Caller and Geller Report exposed what was happening, Mountain Ridge administrators and teachers began messaging parents who were sharing the story, asking them to remove their posts.\\nWhat do they have to hide?\\nApparently, a great deal.\\nWorse still, Penkoski is now being threatened by students who attend the school with his daughter.\\n(And who is behind them?\\nUnidentified “adult friends.”)\\nHe sent this message to me:\\nA student in the school threatened to get her adult friends to come to my home and kill me by stabbing me in the chest and ripping my organs out.\\nThey told my daughter “we are gonna get some people and kill your dad.” This student, who is known to me but whom I cannot name because she is a minor, has given students our address and is encouraging them to come to my home over this whole thing.\\nAnother student told my daughter that she and the first student and her adult friends are going to kill me and carve a satanic star in my chest and rip out my organs.\\nThey then threatened to hang my 3-year-old and 1-year-old and kidnap my 14-year-old.\\nAll this in school today because of the articles.\\nThis is not a joke and needs to be investigated.\\nI have contacted the school’s principal, Dr.\\nBranch, and I trust that he will take this matter seriously and deal with it appropriately.\\nIs the principal acting on this?\\nAnd do the police have any interest in this?\\nOr would that be “islamofauxbic”?\\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\\nPamela

Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).\\nMr. Pompeo promised to “take a look at it.”\\nThat’s not enough.\\nGhost guns are already a problem; they are used not just by lone shooters but as part of criminal enterprises.\\nReleasing instructions for their manufacture, which now only circulate on the dark Web, will lead directly to the loss of more innocent lives.\\nThe administration should stop the State Department from going ahead with this foolhardy move, and Congress should act to plug the loopholes that these guns are designed to take advantage of.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': \"Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”\\n\\nWell, it’s been quite a couple of news weeks for the Catholic Church, hey?\\nMcCarrick, Pineda\/Maradiaga, Fr.\\nJames Larkin getting the boot in Dublin for upholding Catholic teaching on abortion… I know some people are, to put it bluntly, freaking out.\\nThe anger of the laity over the McCarrick situation is boiling over into the Twitter feed of the people we still call “the good bishops”.\\nBishop Thomas Tobin of Providence RI, - nicknamed the “Good Tobin” in contrast to the “Bad Tobin” and FrancisCardinal, Joseph Tobin of Newark – got quite an earful when he tweeted the other day, “Despite the egregious offenses of a few, and despite the faults and sins we all have, I’m very proud of my brother bishops and I admire and applaud the great work they do everyday for Christ and His Church.”\\nThe replies haven’t topped out yet, at 121, nearly all of them expressing outrage at this cavalier attitude toward the revelation that Cardinal McCarrick has been proven to be a life-long homosexual rapist and sexual predator, grooming and trapping young men and children into unwanted sexual contact; and that nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet about it.\\nIt’s clear that even the “good bishops” have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs.\\nAs I wrote elsewhere, since 2002, most Catholics know perfectly well, despite the lame whitewashing attempt, that “the US bishops gave themselves a pass” on clerical sex abuse with the Dallas Charter “a thing that brazenly shifted blame.” And it seems that though they’re still doing this, quite a few lay Catholics just aren’t having it.\\nWe are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years.\\nThe Church was infiltrated, we know this, in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces, and they have finally come into the ascendancy and are showing themselves quite clearly for what they are.\\nThe McCarrick news – and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga – has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it.\\nThe scandal of McCarrick is simply a toxic emission, a venting of the gasses that build up naturally around any rotting thing.\\nRod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang.\\nIt has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one “bad apple” or even only a “few” as the hapless “conservative” Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter.\\nThis is the result of a mass-collusion.\\nAs our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, “We’ve got to stop pretending it’s just the progressive element in the Church.\\nThe ‘conservatives’ are complicit, too.” In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm.\\nWhether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the “New Church.”\\nA point that Dreher’s informants have brought up needs to be made emphatic: the homosexualist cabal that is currently reported to be dominant in the Catholic hierarchy (and don’t imagine this is confined to the United States or even to the English speaking world) have a well documented methodology of mutual protection-and-threat that keeps the whole apparatus afloat.\\nIn briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2].\\nWhen that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control.\\nThis is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed.\\nAs Dreher reported,\\nWhen predatory gay priests run seminaries, they select on a bias for gay candidates...\\nGay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex.\\nIf they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared… And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered.\\nLater, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles.\\nWhen I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men — priests, former priests, seminarians — who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger.\\nNothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.\\nFor many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least.\\nI’ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it.\\nHow are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation?\\nWhere are they to live?\\nHow are they to maintain themselves?\\nThese are the priests who did make it through this institutional gauntlet, who remain faithful now but are still under the control of these often grossly corrupt and evil men.\\nAs men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs.\\nIn short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest’s material life.\\nThe bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless.\\nAnd these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical.\\nMoreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world.\\nAnd with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate.\\nHe will remain a pariah even among the so-called “good” bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal… (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush\/John Paul II.)\\nI have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, “We’re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don’t we’ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we’ll be homeless and penniless.\\nWe’re unemployable in any other field.” And as much as we might be tempted to say, “Well suck it up, this is for the good of souls,” the reality is that these are not small considerations.\\nMany priests are getting older – many of them with health issues – and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.\\nOf course there are some who don’t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need.\\nSome of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives.\\nBut I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops.\\nI think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end.\\nAs one of them said to me, “The old arrangement was, ‘Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you.\\nWe’ll house, feed and clothe you and look after your retirement.’ The new arrangement is a perversion of that: ‘Keep quiet and go along with it all and you’ll be fine, but step an inch out of line and we’ll destroy you.’”\\nSo what do we do?\\nThe Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.\\nAs we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started.\\nIt’s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what.\\nWe need to start working together with faithful priests – while there still are some – to help them create practical material alternatives.\\nIf we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it.\\nThe other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it’s time we all started taking seriously.\\nIn response to the continued outrages of both “good” and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing “an escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.”\\nI responded: “And the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm.\\nWe could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.”\\nI am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution.\\nThis would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff.\\nI started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!]\\n“begging” those manifestly evil and apostate men not to close a famous and ancient monastic house.\\nI responded that this was going about things the wrong way.\\nCatholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, “begging” the hierarchy to maintain the Faith.\\nFirst of all, it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy.\\nLet’s not give them that, OK?\\nThere’s already enough “frissons of pleasure” in their lives.\\nSecond, it’s simply not going to work.\\nIn Germany, in the US, in Canada, in Italy, in Britain… throughout the Church in the 1st world, and in much of it elsewhere, the men in charge of the “institutional Church” – that is, whose names are on the bank accounts – are dedicated to the destruction of everything we want to preserve.\\nThe wolves are now looking with ravening eyes at the faithful.\\nThey are, in short, our enemies.\\nThey’ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church.\\nThey know it and it’s time we stopped imagining otherwise.\\nThe other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.\\nThere’s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily.\\nNo one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he’s a faithful Catholic.\\nWe should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner.\\nHe should own a house or stand to inherit one.\\nFamilies have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church.\\nAnd more than that, the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood.\\nAmong the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work.\\nBut most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia: get something under your belt you can fall back on.\\nHow many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf?\\nChange the oil in a car?\\nRewire a house?\\nThe standard cliché of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it’s not even worth memeing anymore.\\nHow many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong “sexual orientation”?\\nEvery one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job, based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop, but on his solid skills.\\nAmong the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work, but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree.\\nThat’s an economic asset that we can’t afford to turn up our well-educated noses at.\\nDon't miss Hilary White's next article in the July 31 Print Edition of The Remnant Newspaper; Subscribe today!\\n\\n\\nIt reminds me of a discussion I had some years ago with the prior of a Benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations.\\nOne kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first.\\nThis college, apparently, waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap.\\nThis is fine, good idea.\\nBut I asked him what he knew how to do.\\n“Can you fix a bathroom pipe?\\nDo you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow?\\nCan you drive a tractor?” This nice kid, who certainly does have a vocation, could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas, but not a lot else.\\nThere is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions.\\nDoes a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology?\\nWouldn’t it also be useful to have an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a cook, someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor?\\nOr for that matter, a certified accountant or an investment banker?\\nIf you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska.\\nI think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.\\nYoung men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day.\\nSimply put, they’ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy.\\nThis vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time.\\nThe next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I’m going to ask, “How sound is your investment portfolio?” The next candidate for religious life, I’ll ask, “Great!\\nWhat’s your trade?\\nWhat do you have to fall back on?”\\nI’m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we’re seeing elsewhere doesn’t sound like a bad idea.\\nPerhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.\\nMeanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it.\\nThat monastery in Germany is lost.\\nThose bishops want the property and they’ll get it.\\nWhat the group of laymen should be doing, instead of petitioning that it be saved, is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment.\\nBishops won’t protect and support good priests?\\nThen it’s up to us.\\nThe Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants-wearing, Marxist anti-nun, LCWR pattern?\\nWe’re not helpless.\\nWe start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun-refugees.\\nOur goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life.\\nI am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army.\\nThey took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world.\\nOver a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals.\\nTwo trains got away to safety, but one was still there when the Germans surrounded the city and began the siege.\\nThe museum’s website tells us:\\n“Despite starvation and severely cold temperatures, the Museum continued its preservational functions.\\nWith only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain.\\nEquipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area.\\nTwelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.” “Hermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing scholarly articles.\\nNo items were lost during the evacuation.”\\nTo keep up everyone’s morale, the museum staff, while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving, continued to give tours and lectures, describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed.\\nThey understood the value of what they had, and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it.\\nDoes this all sound a bit, well, schismatic?\\nNot necessarily.\\nAny bishop who can demonstrate through his actions and not just with his tweets, who can prove that he is still a Catholic and not a wolf, is welcome to join us.\\nBut we’d be fools to wait for them.\\nWhatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre’s solution over the last few decades, it certainly seems inarguable that the “state of emergency” for which he was preparing has come at last.\\nAnd in a state of emergency, certain norms are naturally suspended.\\nThe simple fact is that soon there are going to be “vagus” priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith.\\nThere are going to be nuns and monks without homes, as in the England of Henry VIII.\\nI think it’s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the Faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can.\\nWhat we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and “beg” bishops to maintain and defend the Faith.\\nIt’s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith.\\nSentiment isn’t going to be much comfort when the young man is no longer so very young and finds himself standing on the street outside the chancery with no skills, no money, no job, (no health insurance) and no prospects.\\nIf it is true that we really are alone in this, then so be it.\\nLet’s stop lamenting and start doing practical things about it.\\n___________________________________\\n[1] Dreher and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men McCarrick is known to have mentored, one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as Pope Francis’ Cardinal Prefect of the new Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, and as the primary organiser of the upcoming World Meeting of Families in his native Dublin.\\nIt should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a “difference of opinion” with the group’s leadership, Cardinal Kevin Farrell as also deeply involved in the Legionaries of Christ.\\nHe joined in 1966, was ordained in ’78, and was quickly appointed to a high-ranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the Legionaries of Christ in Italy, Spain and Ireland until 1983.\\nThis period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt Fr.\\nMaciel, for whom it has been shown ALL the Legion’s leadership was covering.\\nThe Farrell family’s involvement in the Legion continues with his brother, Bishop Brian Farrell, who ordained 20 new priests to the questionable-but-officially-reformed community in 2015.\\nA recent post to the official Regnum Christi website shows that Cardinal Kevin is still close enough to the Legion-related “lay” organisation to hire dicastery staff from their ranks.\\nAfter he left the Legion, Kevin Farrell joined the diocesan clergy in Washington DC and became a protégé of the archbishop, Cardinal Wuerl.\\nSo close is he to McCarrick that Farrell’s coat of arms, as Elizabeth Yore reported in these pages, is not much more than a tribute to his belatedly-disgraced mentor.\\nSo, someone in a journalistic capacity might want to be asking a few questions about these things too.\\n[2] It should also be noted that in his book, The Dictator Pope, historian Henry Sire documented that this is how Jorge Bergoglio has always operated, collecting bad men around him and controlling them with a masterful combination of threats and rewards.\\nThe natural question, “Why does Pope Francis keep such bad men around him?” is now easy to answer.\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Pope Francis Denounces “Murderous Indifference” To Persecution Of Christians, Of Which He Is A Chief Architect\\n\\nAssociated Press reported that the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and other Orthodox Patriarchs met with Pope Francis on Saturday, and that the Pope had some strong words to say about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East.\\nThe Pope couldn’t resist an anti-Semitic shot at Israeli “occupation,” but he also seemed to denounce Islamic jihad activity, saying: “So many conflicts have been stoked too by forms of fundamentalism and fanaticism that, under the guise of religion, have profaned God’s name – which is peace – and persecuted age-old neighbors.” He decried the “thirst for profit that surreptitiously exploits oil and gas fields without regard for our common home, with no scruples about the fact that the energy market now dictates the law of coexistence among peoples!”\\nThe Pope lamented the fact that in recent years the Middle East has been “covered by dark clouds of war, violence and destruction, instances of occupation and varieties of fundamentalism, forced migration and neglect.” And he deplored the fact that “all this has taken place amid the complicit silence of many.\\nThe Middle East has become a land of people who leave their own lands behind.” He cried: “Indifference kills, and we desire to lift up our voices in opposition to this murderous indifference.\\nFor the Middle East today is weeping, suffering and silent as others trample upon those lands in search of power or riches.”\\nThese are odd statements coming from Pope Francis, a world-class Islamopanderer; notice that he said nothing about who was doing the persecuting, and implied that it was the fault of powers outside the Middle East.\\nThe Catholic Church as a whole has committed itself to Islamopandering, such that it is largely silent about the Muslim persecution of Christians that has taken place in the Middle East.\\nWhy?\\nThe Catholic Church is following Pope Francis’ lead, and Francis has said: “Christian terrorism does not exist, Jewish terrorism does not exist, and Muslim terrorism does not exist.\\nThey do not exist.” And he has also said: “Authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.”\\ntake our poll - story continues below\\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\\n* Yes, he will be confirmed.\\nNo, he will not be confirmed.\\nEmail *\\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\\nYou may opt out at anytime.\\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\\nThis has had a terrible influence upon the Catholic Church, and aids and abets the Western political and media elites in their determination to cover up the Muslim persecution of Christians.\\nJean-Clément Jeanbart, the Melkite Greek Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo, gave an interview to a French reporter in which he was highly critical of the mainstream media and even of his fellow bishops for ignoring the Muslim persecution of Middle Eastern Christians.\\n“The European media,” he charged, “have not ceased to suppress the daily news of those who are suffering in Syria and they have even justified what is happening in our country by using information without taking the trouble to verify it.” And as for his brother bishops in France, “the conference of French bishops should have trusted us, it would have been better informed.\\nWhy are your bishops silent on a threat that is yours today as well?\\nBecause the bishops are like you, raised in political correctness.\\nBut Jesus was never politically correct, he was politically just!”\\nArchbishop Jeanbart was not the first to say this.\\n“Why, we ask the western world, why not raise one’s voice over so much ferocity and injustice?” asked Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, the head of the Italian Bishops Conference (CEI).\\nSyriac Catholic Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem Joseph III Younan himself has in the past appealed to the West“not to forget the Christians in the Middle East.” The former Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch Gregory III has also said: “I do not understand why the world does not raise its voice against such acts of brutality.”\\nBut Gregory III should have understood, since he was a major part of the problem.\\nHe himself said: “No one defends Islam like Arab Christians.” It is to defend Islam that Western clerics do not raise their voice against such acts of brutality.\\nIt is to pursue a fruitless and chimerical “dialogue” that bishops in the U.S. and Europe keep silent about Muslim persecution of Christians, and enforce that silence upon others.\\nRobert McManus, Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, Massachusetts, said it on February 8, 2013 as he was suppressing a planned talk at a Catholic conference on that persecution: “Talk about extreme, militant Islamists and the atrocities that they have perpetrated globally might undercut the positive achievements that we Catholics have attained in our inter-religious dialogue with devout Muslims.”\\nRemember that Mohamed Atta, about the plane he had hijacked on September 11, 2001, told passengers over the intercom: “Stay quiet and you’ll be OK.” The Catholic Church appears to have adopted that statement as its policy regarding Muslim persecution of Christians.\\n“Leave them; they are blind guides.\\nAnd if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” (Matthew 15:14)\\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018\\n\\nDuring the last 5 years of this papacy, Francis and his Synodal Schemers masterfully manipulated, rigged, and exploited the synodal process.\\nThe backdoor tactics and machinations were brilliantly documented by Edward Pentin , Henry Sire, George Neumayr and an array of investigative journalists.\\nThe fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.\\n– Shakespeare, As You Like It Pope Francis and Cardinal Farrell sit with students at the 2018 pre-synodal meeting for young people.\\nThe upcoming October 2018 Synod of Bishops guarantees more synodal antics as the doctrinal culmination of the “Who Am I to Judge” mantra and the recantation of Church teaching on homosexuality.\\nPope Francis announced in the Pre-Synodal meeting that the Church will be listening to all the young people and that “no one will be excluded.” That’s code language that the Pope will be “dialoging” and “accompanying” and “hearing” the pro-LBGT agenda.\\nOh, the providential irony!\\nThe two themes of the upcoming Synod of Bishops in Rome are none other than, Youth and Vocations.\\nSound familiar?\\nDo I hear the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report?\\nHow inconvenient that the two targets of predatory clerics and prelates will be the subject of the Synod of Bishops.\\nHow inconvenient that the head of the Synod on Youth and Vocations, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, was the former roommate of the most prolific serial predator of youth and seminarians in the history of the American Church.\\nHow inconvenient that Farrell, Head of this Synod on Youth, roomed with the notorious Cardinal Theodore McCarrick for six years and never knew anything about McCarrick’s predatory behavior.\\nHow inconvenient that a global homosexual clergy predation scandal is erupting at a time when Francis wants the Synod to minimize that nagging and unmerciful Catholic catechism doctrine of homosexuality as “intrinsically disordered” by exploiting the naive views of the youth at the Synod.\\nHow inconvenient that homosexual predation is bankrupting the American Church and the Instrumentum Laboris, the working document of this Vatican Synodal Agenda, embraces the relaxation of the Church teachings on homosexuality.\\nHow inconvenient that the homosexual network of clergy and prelates were blasted as predators and coverup enablers in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, while the Instrumentum Laboris argues that:\\n“Some LGBT youths, through various contributions that were received by the General Secretariat of the Synod, wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the Church, while some Bishop Conferences ask themselves what to suggest to young people who decide to create homosexual instead of heterosexual couples and, above all, would like to be close to the Church.” §197 IL\\nHow inconvenient that during a global prelate homosexual coverup scandal, the 2018 Synodal Bishop Conferences are exploring for ways during the Synod to discuss ways in which homosexual youths want to be “closer” to the Church!\\nHow inconvenient that since 2013 during Francis’ impromptu airplane presser when he cleverly sent a powerful message to homosexual clerics, “Who Am I to Judge,” now Francis must judge the criminal predatory conduct of homosexual clergy and prelates who preyed on youth and seminarians.\\nThe emerging homosexual clergy scandal is just beginning to unfold.\\nThe laity will learn over the course of the next few years that the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network of priests, bishops and cardinals who preyed on the youth, assaulted seminarians, promoted their own ilk, and punished any whistleblowers or noncompliant priests.\\nHere is the dirty secret that is now emerging.\\nMany in the hierarchy were active homosexuals who intentionally relaxed and ignored the Church’s teaching and moral stance on homosexuality.\\nThe personal wreckage brutally portrayed in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report is the direct result of a clerical culture which embraced homosexuality and groomed, recruited, and assaulted young people into this sordid lifestyle.\\nMany priests, bishops, and cardinals practiced what Francis preached, ‘who am I to judge.’\\nThe result?\\nA litany of lives of total moral, physical, emotional devastation suffered by victims of homosexual clerics.\\nThis is just the very beginning of the dark night of the soul of the Catholic Church.\\nThe upcoming Synod and its embrace of the “LGBT” lifestyle makes a mockery of the suffering of the clergy victims and justifies the decades-old scandal.\\nBe forewarned that inviting young people from ages 16-29 to the Synod to discuss vocations with Bishops poses serious moral and physical dangers to these unsuspecting youth, many of whom think homosexuality is cool.\\nAnd the Bishops know it.\\nThe full extent of the clerical predation in the hierarchy will take years to uncover.\\nUntil it has, this Synod must be cancelled while the civil authorities and law enforcement fully investigate the breadth and depth of the homosexual clerical predation.\\nThe warning signs and rainbow flags are flamboyantly flashing that the 2018 Synod on the Youth and Vocations in Rome presents great moral and physical exploitation of the youth.\\nAccording to the Vatican, the chosen topic of the 2018 Synod, is an “expression of the Church’s pastoral concern for the young,” and is in continuity with the findings of the two-fold synod on the family and Francis’s post-synodal document Amoris Laetitia.\\nWe’ve caught on to his sneaky synodal tactics.\\nFrancis cleverly uses the synodal process to relax church doctrine by employing secular tools of surveys and focus groups.\\nAnd, if the necessary results aren’t computed, they will skewer the results.\\nMagisterium by majority vote or stuff the ballot box.\\nThe only compelling “expression of the Church’s pastoral concern for the young” belongs in the full and transparent cooperation of criminal investigations into predatory homosexual predation.\\nTurn over the documents secret archives involving predation, both in the Vatican and in the chanceries around the globe.\\nThat is the only expression that will demonstrate concern for the young.\\nSign the Petition to Stop the Synod Here.\\n\\nEditor's Note: The Remnant has lunched its own #StopTheSynod petition, for those who would rather not go to Change.org.\\nOur petition will remain at the top of our site from now until October, or until the Synod is canceled.\\nPlease sign and encourage your friends, contacts, and social media associates to do the same.\\nMJM\\n______________________________\\nElizabeth Yore is an attorney who has investigated clerical sex abuse cases.\\n\",\n",

As I indicated in my Monday article, when someone in the federal government needs a favor from someone else, the someone else is going to ask for something in return.\\nJFKu2019s War with the... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing.\\nThe fact is that the CIA put in its request to Trump for continued secrecy of its JFK records long before yesterday.\\nBut “Art of the Deal” Trump obviously sat on the request, undoubtedly hoping that he could get what he wanted in return if he just continued holding out and conveying that he was ready to release the records.\\nDon’t forget: According to Trump’s own tweets, he had already ostensibly decided to deny the CIA’s request for secrecy before the Thursday deadline:\\nTrump tweet sent on Saturday, October 21: “Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” Trump tweet sent on Wednesday, October 25: “The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.\\nSo interesting!\\nNow, it’s theoretically possible that the CIA presented Trump with some earthshattering new information on the Thursday deadline that showed that the United States would fall into the ocean if Americans were finally permitted to see the CIA’s long-secret JFK records.\\nBut how likely is that?\\nNot likely at all!\\nInstead, it is a virtual certainly that when Art of the Deal Trump sent out those two tweets, he was sending a message to the CIA as part of the negotiations: Give me what I want or I will release the records.\\nIn the negotiations, both Trump and the CIA knew that Trump was in the catbird seat.\\nThe Kennedy Autopsy Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\\nIn the end, the CIA blinked, just as Trump knew it would.\\nContrary to what the mainstream press is asserting, the records undoubtedly contain more incriminating circumstantial evidence that fills in the mosaic of a U.S. national-security regime-change operation on November 22, 1963.\\nThat’s what the mainstream media, forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is, simply cannot bring themselves to confront.\\nTrump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel.\\nAs I indicated in my two articles this week, the CIA was between a rock and a hard place.\\nOn the one hand, it could refuse to grant Trump what he wanted and let the records be released, which it knew would point to the CIA’s guilt in the assassination.\\nOn the other hand, it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw — that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence.\\nWhat did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump’s extending the CIA’s 50-year-plus secrecy?\\nWe don’t know, but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia.\\nHere’s my next prediction: the congressional investigations into Trump’s supposed “collusion” with Russia are about to fizzle out.\\nThat’s because I believe that the CIA, as part of its deal with Trump, will order its assets in Congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation.\\nIn my opinion, that’s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover-up of its U.S. regime-change operation in November 1963.\\nNotice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA: The secrecy arrangement extends only to April.\\nOstensibly, the next six months are needed to carefully review the records to determine whether the records really to relate to “national security.” Regime Change: The JFK...
